AB A multivariate Birnbaum-Saunders distribution is introduced to consider a new nonparametric multivariate density estimation for nonnegative data. By construction, the estimator is the average of varying nonnegative kernel with correlation structure, whose support matches the support of the density to be estimated, unlike the classical Rosenblatt-Parzen kernel density estimator. The proposed kernel density estimator is nonnegative, boundary-bias-free and has desirable asymptotic properties. The finite sample performance of the estimator is investigated for the bivariate case. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Finite mixture models have recently been considered for analyzing positive support economical data streams with non-normal features. In this paper, a new mixture model based on the novel class of generalized Birnbaum-Saunders distributions is proposed to enhance strength and flexibility in modeling heterogeneous lifetime data. Some characteristics and properties of this mixture model are outlined. By presenting a convenient hierarchical representation, a mathematically elegant and computationally tractable EM-type algorithm is adopted for computing maximum likelihood estimates. Theoretical formulae of well-known risk measures referring to the class of generalized Birnbaum-Saunders distributions are derived. Finally, the utility of the postulated methodology is illustrated with some real-world data examples. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Birnbaum-Saunders (BS) distribution is a model that frequently appears in the statistical literature and has proved to be very versatile and efficient across a wide range of applications. However, despite the growing interest in the study of the BS distribution, quantile regression modeling has not been considered for this distribution. To fill this gap, we introduce a class of quantile regression models based on the BS distribution, which allows us to describe positive and asymmetric data when a quantile must be predicted using covariates. We use an approach based on a quantile parameterization to generate the model, permitting us to consider a similar framework to generalized linear models, providing wide flexibility. The methodology proposed includes a thorough study of theoretical properties and practical issues, such as maximum likelihood parameter estimation and diagnostic analytics based on local influence and residuals. The performance of the residuals is evaluated by simulations, whereas an illustrative example of income data is conducted using the methodology to show its potential for applications. The numerical results report an adequate performance of the approach to quantile regression, indicating that the BS distribution is a good modeling choice when dealing with data that have both positive support and asymmetry. The economic implications of our investigation are discussed in the final section. Hence, it can be a valuable addition to the tool kit of applied statisticians and econometricians.

AB The sample selection bias problem occurs when the outcome of interest is only observed according to some selection rule, where there is a dependence structure between the outcome and the selection rule. In a pioneering work, J. Heckman proposed a sample selection model based on a bivariate normal distribution for dealing with this problem. Due to the non-robustness of the normal distribution, many alternatives have been introduced in the literature by assuming extensions of the normal distribution like the Student-t and skew-normal models. One common limitation of the existent sample selection models is that they require a transformation of the outcome of interest, which is common R+ -valued, such as income and wage. With this, data are analyzed on a non-original scale which complicates the interpretation of the parameters. In this paper, we propose a sample selection model based on the bivariate Birnbaum-Saunders distribution, which has the same number of parameters that the classical Heckman model. Further, our associated outcome equation is R+ -valued. We discuss estimation by maximum likelihood and present some Monte Carlo simulation studies. An empirical application to the ambulatory expenditures data from the 2001 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey is presented.

AB High-density polyethylene exhibits discontinuous slow crack growth (SCG) mode in fatigue and creep conditions. To simulate the unique SCG mode, the crack layer (CL) theory can be adopted as an alternative method. However, the stochastic approach is also required for reliability-related problems. In this study, the current deterministic CL model was modified to describe the stochastic discontinuous SCG. First, the influence of the normally distributed nine input parameters in CL simulation on discontinuous SCG kinetics and the resulting lifetime distributions were thoroughly investigated. Second, important CL parameters that affect discontinuous SCG kinetics and the final lifetimes were identified. Then, the 2- and 3-parameter Weibull function and the Birnbaum-Saunders (B-S) function were compared to determine the function that correctly fits the lifetime distribution from discontinuous SCG. Finally, appropriate equations of the scale and shape parameters of the B-S function were developed with regard to the identified parameters. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A transformed Gaussian model is proposed for the atoms of the kernel stick-breaking process by transforming the margins of a Gaussian process to flexible marginal distributions. This study proves that the correlation structure of the underlying spatial process is nonstationary. Results from both simulated and real datasets demonstrate that the proposed model possesses better spatial prediction performance and offers computational advantages compared to the Bayesian nonparametric model with the Gaussian base measure.

AB The Birnbaum-Saunders (BS) distribution, introduced in 1969, is a popular univariate fatigue life distribution which has been widely used to model right-skewed lifetime and reliability data. In this paper, a new class of generalized multivariate BS distributions is proposed based on mean-variance mixture models to accommodate strongly skewed and heavy tailed multivariate lifetime data. Some special cases of this class as well as their properties are then discussed. We present a hierarchical representation which facilitates an efficient EM-type algorithm for the computation of maximum likelihood estimates. Empirical results from a simulation study and real data analyses show that this class of distributions outperforms many existing extensions of the BS distribution in modeling lifetime data.

However, if inappropriate analysis methods are applied, then unreliable conclusions can be made. This work deals with estimation and diagnostic analytics in regression modelling based on the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution using additive measurement errors. The maximum pseudo-likelihood and regression calibration methods are used for parameter estimation. We also carry out a residual analysis and apply global and local diagnostic techniques in order to detect anomalous and potentially influential observations. Simulations are conducted to validate the proposed approach and to evaluate performance. A real-world data set, related to earthquakes, is used to illustrate the new approach.

In this paper, a new finite mixture model via an extension of Birnbaum-Saunders distribution is introduced. The new mixture model provide a useful generalization of the heavy-tailed lifetime model since the mixing components cover both skewness and kurtosis. Some properties and characteristics of the model are derived and an expectation and maximization (EM)-type algorithm is developed to compute maximum likelihood estimates. The asymptotic standard errors of the parameter estimates are obtained via offering an information-based approach. Finally, the performance of the methodology is illustrated by considering both simulated and real datasets. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Atlantis Press SARL.

AB In this paper, we propose a general family of Birnbaum-Saunders autoregressive conditional duration (BS-ACD) models based on generalized Birnbaum-Saunders (GBS) distributions, denoted by GBS-ACD. We further generalize these GBS-ACD models by using a Box-Cox transformation with a shape parameter lambda to the conditional median dynamics and an asymmetric response to shocks; this is denoted by GBS-AACD. We then carry out a Monte Carlo simulation study to evaluate the performance of the GBS-ACD models. Finally, an illustration of the proposed models is made by using New York stock exchange (NYSE) transaction data.

AB Packaging during the passaging of viruses in cell cultures yields various phenotypes and is regulated by viral protein expression in infected cells. Although such a packaging mechanism has a profound effect in controlling the virus yield, little is known about the underlying statistical models followed by virus packaging and protein expression among cells infected with the virus. A predictive framework combining identification of the probability density function (PDF) based on log-likelihood and using the PDF for Monte-Carlo simulations is developed. The Birnbaum-Saunders distribution was found to be consistent with all three-virus packaging levels, including nucleocapsids/occlusion-derived virus (ODV), ODVs/polyhedra, and polyhedra/cell for both wild-type and genetically modified AcMNPV. Next, it was demonstrated that PDF fitting could be used to compare two viruses having distinctly different genetic configurations. Finally, the identified PDF can be incorporated in RNA synthesis parameters for baculovirus infection to predict the cell-to-cell variability in protein expression using Monte-Carlo simulations. The proposed tool can be used for the estimation of uncertainty in the kinetic parameter and prediction of cell-to-cell variability for other biological systems.

AB In this paper, we propose control charts for monitoring the Birnbaum-Saunders (BS) median parameter (scale parameter) on the basis of three estimators. Comparison of the control charts in terms of average run length using probability control limits and those based on asymptotic distribution of three estimators for the median parameter is developed. We also present guidelines for practitioners about the minimum sample size needed to match out-of-control average run length with the asymptotic control limits in function of the median parameter after an extensive simulation study. Numerical example illustrates the applied monitoring of BS median parameter.

AB This article proposes a new approach to the conditional autoregressive range (CARR) model using the Birnbaum-Saunders (BS) distribution. The model aims to develop volatility clustering, which incorporates extreme fluctuations, using a time-varying evolution of the range process called the BSCARR model. Furthermore, diagnosis analysis tools for diagnosis analysis were developed to evaluate the goodness of fit, such as residual analysis, global influence measures based on Cook's distance, and local influence analysis. For illustrative purposes, three real financial market indices are analyzed. A comparison with classical CARR models was also carried out in these examples. The results indicated that the proposed model outperformed some existing models in the literature, especially a recent CARR model based on the gamma distribution even under the presence of atypical cases (observed values).

ID SUBTYPE
AB Background: Survival time is one of the indicators used for evaluation of the quality of care in different types of malignancies, including breast cancer. The present study aimed to estimate the survival rate of breast cancer and its related factors among Iranian patients.
   Methods: Overall, 3148 cases of breast cancer who referred to the Cancer Research Center in Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran during 1994-2017 participated in this longitudinal study. Survival estimates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and the Bayesian generalized Birnbaum-Saunders model with cure rate from geometric distribution. Clinical, pathological, and biological variables as potential prognostic factors were entered in univariate and multivariate analyses.
   In order to identify the significant prognostic factors, 95% highest posterior density (HPD) intervals were used.
   Results: The overall 1, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25-year survival rate were 95%, 75%, 60%, 47%, 46% and 46%, respectively. A significant relation was observed between survival time and the variables such as age, size of tumor, number of lymph nodes, stage, histological grade, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and lymphovascular invasion.
   Conclusion: The findings of this study might help the health managers to plan long-term programs considering regional determinants, public education, and screening for early detection of breast cancer cases which can eventually influence the overall survival rate of these patients.

   video encoding parameters; adaptation strategies; blockiness; blurriness
AB The expectations of modern mobile users are increasingly moving towards being able to access demanding services regardless of context or system influence factors, such as network conditions, service topology, and device processing capabilities. Multiparty audiovisual telemeetings are an example of a real-time, delay sensitive, and heavy load service, demanding to run on smartphones that are limited in display size, processing power, and battery capacity. In this paper, we first provide an overview of multiparty audiovisual calls established via mobile devices and key aspects influencing Quality of Experience (QoE). We then report on the results of five user studies conducted over the course of the past 4 years, focused on investigating the impact of video quality in terms of different video encoding parameter configurations (namely bitrate, frame rate, and resolution) on subjective QoE scores for WebRTC-based video calls. We identify lower and upper bounds on video configuration parameters when used in the context of three-party calls. Results have shown that in certain cases it is better to provide constant lower objective video quality than to switch between higher and lower qualities, since participants start to perceive impairments. Finally, we investigate the relationship between objectively measured video quality impairments (blurriness and blockiness) and subjective user scores. Obtained results indicate that the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution for blockiness and the Burr and Gamma distributions for blurriness provide good fits for quality ratings. Gathered results aim to provide input for deriving QoE-aware service adaptation strategies, enabling increased resource allocation efficiency while maintaining acceptable end-user QoE.

Initially, we developed a new version of the skew-sinh-normal distribution, describing some of its properties. For the proposed regression model, we carry out, through the expectation conditional maximization (ECM) algorithm, parameter estimation, model fit assessment, model comparison and residual analysis. Finally, our model accommodates more suitably the asymmetry of the data, compared with the usual log Birnbaum-Saunders model, which is illustrated through a real data analysis.

AB There is detailed, consistent, and rigorous general probability model of growth of a one-sided crack for a metallic block presented below. So far there is no such model for a development of a fatigue cracks from upper and bottom sides of the block. Our goal is to present such detailed, consistent, and rigorous general probability model of growth of a two-sided cracks. The significance of this research follows from the fact that such type of investigations have numerous applications in physics, engineering, statistics, environment studies and economics.

AB Despite the many attractive features of wind-based renewables, the intermittency of wind generation stands out as a critical challenge. An accurate and reliable nonparametric wind speed probability density model is proposed in this paper based on the application of local linear regression in tandem with a root transformation method, introduced here for the first time. The proposed root-transformed local linear regression approach provides a robust estimate of wind speed distribution and produces more accurate results than kernel density estimation models. The performance of the root-transformed local linear regression estimator is assessed via comparisons with three popular parametric models (Rayleigh, Weibull and Gaussian distributions), two additional parametric models (Birnbaum-Saunders and Nakagami distributions) recently suggested for wind speed probability density estimation, and two nonparametric kernel density estimation models using two standard goodness-of-fit hypothesis tests (Chi-squared and Kolmogorov-Smirnov), coefficient of determination and two error metrics (root mean square error and mean absolute error). Results confirm the accuracy of the proposed root-transformed local linear regression estimator for modelling wind speed probability density, with substantial improvements in all error metrics over parametric and kernel density estimation models.

AB For accelerated degradation testing, data analysis based on stochastic process has been drawn much attention. However, there is significant difference in reliability prediction based on different process. This paper proposes a unified distribution model combined with a stochastic process model in multiple accelerated stress degradation test. To solve the problem of heterogeneous population of pseudo failure data, the Birnbaum-Saunders model is considered as a unified distribution model for different Gaussian family process. To give an example, a detailed proof for substituting the Birnbaum-Saunders model for the first-passage time of Wiener process is provided. Then, the influence of the parameters of the Birnbaum-Saunders model was analyzed, which provided a basis for the Birnbaum-Saunders model to be selected as a unified model. To verify presented model, a case study of Smart Meter ADT is conducted. And the obtained results of this work is compared with former work of Smart Meter ADT modeling, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed modeling method to heterogeneous population.

AB The Birnbaum-Saunders distribution is a widely studied model with diverse applications. Its origins are in the modeling of lifetimes associated with material fatigue. By using a motivating example, we show that, even when lifetime data related to fatigue are modeled, the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution can be unsuitable to fit these data in the distribution tails. Based on the nice properties of the Birnbaum-Saunders model, in this work, we use a modified skew-normal distribution to construct such a model. This allows us to obtain flexibility in skewness and kurtosis, which is controlled by a shape parameter. We provide a mathematical characterization of this new type of Birnbaum-Saunders distribution and then its statistical characterization is derived by using the maximum-likelihood method, including the associated information matrices. In order to improve the inferential performance, we correct the bias of the corresponding estimators, which is supported by a simulation study. To conclude our investigation, we retake the motivating example based on fatigue life data to show the good agreement between the new type of Birnbaum-Saunders distribution proposed in this work and the data, reporting its potential applications.

AB Modern financial markets now record the precise time of each stock trade, along with price and volume, with the aim of analysing the structure of the times between trading events-leading to a big data problem. In this paper, we propose and compare two Birnbaum-Saunders autoregressive conditional duration models specified in terms of time-varying conditional median and mean durations. These models provide a novel alternative to the existing autoregressive conditional duration models due to their flexibility and ease of estimation. Diagnostic tools are developed to allowgoodness-of-fit assessment and to detect departures from assumptions, including the presence of outliers and influential cases. These diagnostic tools are based on the parameter estimates using residual analysis and the Cook distance for global influence, and different perturbation schemes for local influence. A thorough Monte Carlo study is presented to evaluate the performance of the maximum likelihood estimators, and the forecasting ability of the models is assessed using the traditional and density forecast evaluation techniques. The Monte Carlo study suggests that the parameter estimators are asymptotically unbiased, consistent and normally distributed. Finally, a full analysis of a real-world financial transaction data set, from the German DAX in 2016, is presented to illustrate the proposed approach and to compare the fitting and forecasting performances with existing models in the literature. One case related to the duration time is identified as potentially influential, but its removal does not change resulting inferences demonstrating the robustness of the proposed approach. Fitting and forecasting performances favor the proposed models and, in particular, the median-based approach gives additional protection against outliers, as expected.

We first derive the relationship between the MLEs of the two parameters and then discuss the monotonicity property of the profile likelihood function. Numerical iterative procedure is then discussed for determining the MLEs of the parameters. Finally, for illustrative purpose, we analyze one real data from the literature and present some graphical illustrations of the approach.

Parameter estimation is considered via an iterative maximum likelihood approach.

AB With the advancement of technology, data are often recorded continuously and instantaneously. Since the early nineties, this kind of observations have been described by models for functional data. Usually a large set of records for each individual in the sample become in a curve (by using some smoothing method) which is considered as a realization of a random function. In functional regression models these curves are used to establish whether there is a relation with an scalar response (functional regression model with scalar response). If two or more sets of curves are obtained for each individual, more complex functional regression models can be established. In particular, in geosciences, where spatial statistics is a primary tool, functional regression is becoming more frequent. Therefore, it is of interest to develop methodologies for spatially correlated functional data. Also in geosciences, as well as in other areas, it is common that the response variables follow positive skew distributions (for example, those obtained in studies about the level of chemical elements in soil or air). Hence, the standard geostatistical assumption of Gaussian errors, or at least of symmetry, is inappropriate. This type of variables, in non-spatial contexts, have been successfully described by the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution, becoming its modeling a very active research field. However, the use of this distribution in the treatment of geostatistical data has only been applied under stationarity. This paper develops a Birnbaum-Saunders model for geostatistical data considering a non-stationary process using functional covariates. The corresponding parameters are estimated by maximum likelihood and their performance is evaluated through Monte Carlo simulations. We illustrate the proposed model with two geo-referenced data sets, which shows its potential applications and a better performance in relation to the Gaussian model.

AB The presence of outliers, skewness, kurtosis, and dependency are well-known challenges while fitting distributions to many data sets. Developing multivariate distributions that can properly accomodate all these aspects has been the aim of several researchers. In this regard, we introduce here a new multivariate skew-normal mean-variance mixture based on Birnbaum Saunders distribution. The resulting model is a good alternative to some skewed distributions, especially the skew-t model. The proposed model is quite flexible in terms of tail behavior and skewness, and also displays good performance in the presence of outliers. For the determination of maximum likelihood estimates, a computationally efficient Expectation-Conditional-Maximization (ECM) algorithm is developed. The performance of the proposed estimation methodology is illustrated through Monte Carlo simulation studies as well as with some real life examples. (C) 2019 The Authors.

ID MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; DISTRIBUTIONS
AB Despite the widespread use of Gaussian mixture model for clustering datasets, practical applications show that the skewed and leptokurtic mixture models can be considered as promising alternatives. This paper proposes a finite mixture of Birnbaum-Saunders (FM-BS) distributions for analyzing and clustering right-skewed, leptokurtic, and multimodal lifetime datasets. The maximum likelihood (ML) estimates of the proposed model are obtained by developing a computationally analytical expectation-maximization (EM) type algorithm, as well as a fuzzy classification maximum likelihood (FCML) type algorithm, that combines the advantages of fuzzy clustering and robust statistical estimators. Simulation studies demonstrate the accuracy and computational efficiency of the FCML algorithm to estimate parameters of the FM-BS distributions and to cluster samples drawn from the FM-BS distributions. Finally, some real datasets have been analyzed to illustrate how well the proposed FM-BS model estimates the membership values. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the last decade, Diaz-Garcia and Leiva-Sanchez (2005, 2007) proposed a generalized Birnbaum-Saunders distribution based on elliptically contoured distributions. A special case of this generalization is Student's t Birnbaum-Saunders distribution. This flexible lifetime distribution generalizes both the Cauchy Birnbaum-Saunders distribution and the two-parameter Birnbaum-Saunders distribution. In this comparison paper, we discuss maximum likelihood estimation methods for the parameters of this distribution. We numerically illustrate and examine the performances of all discussed methods using extensive Monte Carlo simulations and illustrative examples. Furthermore, we analyze real-life data to assess the practical usage of the considered generalized family of distributions, and to illustrate the discussed estimation methods.

AB Purpose Lifetime data are used in many different applied sciences, like biomedicine, engineering, insurance and finance and others. The purpose of this paper is to develop a new acceptance sampling plans for Rama distribution when the mean lifetime test is truncated at a pre-determined time. The minimum sample sizes required to assert the specified life mean is obtained for a given customer's risk. The operating characteristic function values of the sampling plans and producer's risk are calculated. Design/methodology/approach The results are illustrated using numerical examples and a real data set is considered to illustrate the performance of the suggested acceptance sampling plans and how it can be used for the industry applications. Findings This paper shows a new acceptance sampling plans based on Rama distribution in the particular case when the mean life time test is truncated. Originality/value The results calculated in this paper demonstrate the differences between OC values for different distributions taken into account. In particular, OC values of Rama distribution are found to be less than the proposed distribution counterparts.

AB Two-parameter Birnbaum-Saunders distribution has been widely studied in Reliability Theory due to its important Engineering applications. This article proposes a novel confidence intervals construction for the shape and scale parameters of the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution. We apply the following two methods: The generalized pivotal approach and the percentile bootstrap approach. The Monte Carlo simulations are used to evaluate the performance of the confidence intervals. We compare the coverage probability and average width of the proposed confidence intervals with already known. Simulation results have shown that the proposed confidence intervals perform well in terms of coverage probability and average length for various sample sizes. The illustrative example and some concluding remarks are finally presented.

AB Particulate matter (PM) pollution is a serious environmental problem. Santiago of Chile is one of the most polluted cities in the world in terms of PM2.5 and PM10. Monitoring of environmental risk is useful for detecting and preventing adverse effects on human health in highly polluted cities. In this paper, we propose a methodology for monitoring PM pollution in Santiago based on bivariate quality control charts and an asymmetric distribution. A simulation study is carried out to evaluate performance of the proposed methodology. A case study with PM pollution real-world data from Santiago is provided, which shows that the methodology is suitable to alert early episodes of extreme air pollution. The results are in agreement with the critical episodes reported with the current model used by the Chilean health authority.

AB In chemometrical applications, covariates in regression models are often correlated, causing a collinearity problem that can be solved by partial least squares (PLS) regression. In addition, high dimensionality in the space of covariates is also a problem with more parameters than cases, a phenomenon usually found in chemical spectral data that can also be solved by PLS regression. The Birnbaum-Saunders distribution has theoretical justifications for modeling chemical data. In this paper, a new methodology based on PLS regression models is proposed considering a reparameterized Birnbaum-Saunders (RBS) distribution for the response, which is useful for describing asymmetric data frequently found in chemical phenomena. We estimate the RBS-PLS model parameters using the maximum likelihood method. A bootstrap approach is employed to obtain the optimal number of PLS components. Quantile residuals and Cook and Mahalanobis type distances are utilized for detecting possible anomalies in the modeling. We conduct perturbation studies to assess the performance of these diagnostic tools. The proposed methodology is applied to real-world kaolinite data and compared to other competing models. This provides a useful illustration of chemical analysis in the mining industry.

AB Birnbaum-Saunders models have been widely used to describe data following positive-skew distributions. In this article, we introduce a bivariate Birnbaum-Saunders distribution which has the mean as one of its parameters, allowing us to mimic the standard parameterization of the normal distribution, but in an asymmetric framework. We derive some properties of the mean-based bivariate Birnbaum-Saunders distribution useful for statistical and reliability analyses. Maximum likelihood and modified moment estimations of the model parameters and associated inference are considered. A simulation study is conducted to evaluate the performance of the corresponding estimators and coverage probabilities of confidence intervals are also discussed. Finally, a real-world data analysis is carried out for illustrating the potential of the proposed model.

AB Remaining useful life prediction of a system is one of the most important and critical items to achieve the optimal condition-based maintenance for availability and reliability increase, and maintenance reduction. We develop an artificial neural network (ANN) based approach to increase accuracy for the prediction of a system/component remaining useful life. The ANN model takes the working time/age and some parameters produced by a condition monitoring process at the present and previous inspection points as the inputs, and the percentage of the life is produced as the output. Also, different distribution functions, such as Weibull, Birnbaum-Saunders, Gamma, Wakeby, Logistic and Log-normal function are utilized to adjust each condition monitoring data for a failure history, and the adjusted values are applied to determine the training set so as to decrease the noise factors influences unrelated to the degradation of the equipment. The ANN method is validated using the collected vibration monitoring data from a particular machine (pump bearings in the field). Finally, the performance of the distribution functions on the results of the ANN output is compared and the more effective functions are defined.

AB The cumulative exposure model (CEM) is a commonly used statistical model utilized to analyze data from a step-stress accelerated life testing which is a special class of accelerated life testing (ALT). In practice, researchers conduct ALT to: (1) determine the effects of extreme levels of stress factors (e.g., temperature) on the life distribution, and (2) to gain information on the parameters of the life distribution more rapidly than under normal operating (or environmental) conditions. In literature, researchers assume that the CEM is from well-known distributions, such as the Weibull family. This study, on the other hand, considers a p-step-stress model with q stress factors from the two-parameter Birnbaum-Saunders distribution when there is a time constraint on the duration of the experiment. In this comparison paper, we consider different frameworks to numerically compute the point estimation for the unknown parameters of the CEM using the maximum likelihood theory. Each framework implements at least one optimization method; therefore, numerical examples and extensive Monte Carlo simulations are considered to compare and numerically examine the performance of the considered estimation frameworks.

AB In this paper, a real time reliability evaluation and residual life prediction methods for an individual product based on Gamma degradation process are studied. In order to obtain the real time reliability assessment, a conditional reliability model is established and a Bayesian updating theory is used to update the model parameters. In order to obtain the residual life of individual product, the lifetime distribution is approximated by using a Birnbaum-Saunders distribution. Considering the model is very complicated, the estimators of the unknown parameters are obtained via Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. At last, a numerical example about laser device is given to verify the validity of the present model and method.

AB This paper discusses a nonparametric method to approximate the first passage time (FPT) distribution of the degradation processes incorporating random effects if the process type is unknown. The FPT of a degradation process is unnecessarily observed since its density function can be approximated by inverting the empirical Laplace transform using the empirical saddlepoint method. The empirical Laplace transform is composed of the measured increments of the degradation processes. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, the approximated FPT is compared with the theoretical FPT assuming a true underlying process. The nonparametric method discussed in this paper is shown to possess the comparatively small relative errors in the simulation study and performs well to capture the heterogeneity in the practical data analysis. To justify the fitting results, the goodness-of-fit tests including Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and Cramer-von Mises test are conducted, and subsequently, a bootstrap confidence interval is constructed in terms of the 90th percentile of the FPT distribution.

We develop a computationally analytical EM algorithm for model fitting. Due to the dependence of this algorithm on initial values and the number of mixing components, a learning-based EM algorithm and an extended variant are proposed. Numerical simulations show that the proposed algorithms allow for better clustering performance and classification accuracy than some competing approaches. The effectiveness and prominence of the proposed methodology are also shown through an application to an extrasolar planet dataset. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The wind power generated by a wind plant has a stochastic nature due to randomness in the wind speed. Although the empirical distribution of the wind power has been extensively studied by using data sets in different regions, several works focused on theoretical distribution of the wind power produced by wind turbines. In this paper, the theoretical distribution of the wind plant power is obtained. In the derivation of the distribution of the wind plant power, wind turbine reliability is taken into account. The wind plant power distribution can be effectively used if the wind speed probability distribution is known. Theoretical results are illustrated for Weibull and Bimbaum-Saunders wind speed distributions which have been found to be suitable for real data collected at two different locations.

AB The Birnbaum-Saunders (BS) distribution has been largely studied and applied. A random variable with BS distribution is a transformation of another random variable with standard normal distribution. Generalized BS distributions are obtained when the normally distributed random variable is replaced by another symmetrically distributed random variable. This allows us to obtain a wide class of positively skewed models with lighter and heavier tails than the BS model. Its failure rate admits several shapes, including the unimodal case, with its change-point being able to be used for different purposes. For example, to establish the reduction in a dose, and then in the cost of the medical treatment. We analyze the failure rates of generalized BS distributions obtained by the logistic, normal and Student-t distributions, considering their shape and change-point, estimating them, evaluating their robustness, assessing their performance by simulations, and applying the results to real data from different areas.

AB The log-linear Birnbaum-Saunders model has been widely used in empirical applications. We introduce an extension of this model based on a recently proposed version of the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution which is more flexible than the standard Birnbaum-Saunders law since its density may assume both unimodal and bimodal shapes. We show how to perform point estimation, interval estimation and hypothesis testing inferences on the parameters that index the regression model we propose. We also present a number of diagnostic tools, such as residual analysis, local influence, generalized leverage, generalized Cook's distance and model misspecification tests. We investigate the usefulness of model selection criteria and the accuracy of prediction intervals for the proposed model. Results of Monte Carlo simulations are presented. Finally, we also present and discuss an empirical application.

AB In this work, we propose a goodness-of-fit test based on the Kullback-Leibler information for the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution. We use Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the size and power of the proposed test for several alternative hypotheses under different sample sizes. We compare the powers with standard goodness-of-fit tests based as the Anderson-Darling and Cramer-von Mises tests. Finally, we illustrate the proposed test with a real data set to show its potential applications.

AB In this paper, we introduce a new distribution for positively skewed data by combining the Birnbaum-Saunders and centered skew-normal distributions. Several of its properties are developed. Our model accommodates both positively and negatively skewed data. Also, we show that our proposal circumvents some problems related to another Birnbaum-Saunders distribution based on the usual skew-normal model, previously presented in the literature. We derive both maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference, comparing them through a suitable simulation study. The convergence of the expectation conditional maximization (for maximum likelihood inference) and MCMC algorithms (for Bayesian inference) are verified and several factors of interest are compared. In general, as the sample size increases, the results indicate that the Bayesian approach provided the most accurate estimates. Our model accommodates the asymmetry of the data more properly than the usual Birnbaum-Saunders distribution, which is illustrated through real data analysis.

AB Birnbaum-Saunders (BS) distribution is a model with positive domain that is used in many fields including reliability and environmental studies. This article introduces a generalized version of the BS distribution which arises from the shape mixture of skew-normal distribution. A feasible EM type algorithm is developed to obtain maximum likelihood (ML) estimates of parameters of the new model. The asymptotic standard errors of ML estimates are obtained via the information-based approximation. The robustness and application of the proposed methodology are illustrated through simulation studies and air pollution analysis.

AB The reliability R = P(Y < X) is derived based on progressively Type-II censored samples, when X and Y are independent Birnbaum-Saunders distributions with the same shape parameter but different scale parameters, and all of these parameters are unknown. The maximum likelihood estimate of R is derived and the approximate variance is constructed by combining delta and Monte Carlo (MC) methods. Then, Bayesian inference is performed to derive R and to predict the times to failure of the items censored in multiple stages of progressively type-II data with two Markov Chain MC (MCMC) algorithms. One algorithm is the hybrid Metropolis-Gibbs methodology, which considers the censored data to be unknown parameters along with model parameters and includes them in MCMC sampler to obtain parameter estimation. In the other algorithm, the unknown parameters are considered in the Metropolis methodology to construct Bayesian estimation and then to predict censored observations. Two illustrative examples are finally provided to examine the performance of the proposed methods.

AB Goodness-of-fit tests are constructed for the two-parameter Birnbaum-Saunders distribution in the case where the parameters are unknown and therefore are estimated from the data. In each test, the procedure starts by computing efficient estimators of the parameters. Then the data are transformed by a normal transformation and normality tests are applied on the transformed data, thereby avoiding reliance on parametric asymptotic critical values or the need for bootstrap computations. Three classes of tests are considered, the first class being the classical tests based on the empirical distribution function, while the other class utilizes the empirical characteristic function and the final class utilizes the Kullback-Leibler information function. All methods are extended to cover the case of generalized three-parameter Birnbaum-Saunders distributions.

AB This paper presents a skew-normal mean-variance mixture based on Birnbaum-Saunders (SNMVBS) distribution and discusses some of its key properties. The SNMVBS distribution can be thought as a flexible extension of the normal mean-variance mixture based on Birnbaum-Saunders (NMVBS) distribution as it possesses one additional shape parameter for providing more flexibility with skewness and kurtosis. Next, we develop a computationally feasible ECM algorithm for the maximum like-lihood estimation of the model parameters. Asymptotic standard errors of the ML estimates are obtained through an approximation of the observed information matrix. Finally, the usefulness of the proposed model and its fitting method are illustrated through a Monte-Carlo simulation as well as three real-life datasets.

AB The generalization of Birnbaum-Saunders (BS) distribution has recently received considerable attention to provide accurate inferential results in dealing with survival data, reliability problems, fatigue life studies and hydrological data. This paper introduces a new extension of the BS distribution based on the normal mean-variance mixture of Lindley distribution. Since the proposed lifetime distribution can take positive and negative skewness and can have decreasing, increasing, upside-down bathtub, increasing-decreasing-increasing and decreasing-increasing-decreasing hazard rate functions, it may provide more flexible model than the existing extensions of BS distribution. Some properties of the new distribution are derived and the computationally analytical EM-type algorithm is developed for computing maximum likelihood estimates. Finally, the performance of the proposed methodology is illustrated through analyzing two real data sets.

AB The new distributions are very useful in describing real data sets, because these distributions are more flexible to model real data that present a high degree of skewness and kurtosis. The choice of the best-suited statistical distribution for modeling data is very important. In this paper, A new class of distributions called the New odd log-logistic generalized half-normal (NOLL-GHN) family with four parameters is introduced and studied. This model contains sub-models such as half-normal (HN), generalized half-normal (GHN) and odd log-logistic generalized half-normal (OLL-GHN) distributions. some statistical properties such as moments and moment generating function have been calculated. The Biases and MSE's of estimator methods such as maximum likelihood estimators, least squares estimators, weighted least squares estimators, Cramer-von-Mises estimators, Anderson-Darling estimators and right tailed Anderson-Darling estimators are calculated. The fitness capability of this model has been investigated by fitting this model and others based on real data sets. The maximum likelihood estimators are assessed with simulated real data from proposed model. We present the simulation in order to test validity of maximum likelihood estimators.

ID LIFE TESTS; ACCEPTANCE; INSPECTION; FAMILY
AB Acceptance sampling is one of the essential areas of quality control. In a conventional environment, probability theory is used to study acceptance sampling plans. In some situations, it is not possible to apply conventional techniques due to vagueness in the values emerging from the complexities of processor measurement methods. There are two types of acceptance sampling plans: attribute and variable. One of the important elements in attribute acceptance sampling is the proportion of defective items. In some situations, this proportion is not a precise value, but vague. In this case, it is suitable to apply flexible techniques to study the fuzzy proportion. Fuzzy set theory is used to investigate such concepts. It is observed there is no research available to apply Birnbaum-Saunders distribution in fuzzy acceptance sampling. In this article, it is assumed that the proportion of defective items is fuzzy and follows the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution. A single acceptance sampling plan, based on binomial distribution, is used to design the fuzzy operating characteristic (FOC) curve. Results are illustrated with examples. One real-life example is also presented in the article. The results show the behavior of curves with different combinations of parameters of Birnbaum-Saunders distribution. The novelty of this study is to use the probability distribution function of Birnbaum-Saunders distribution as a proportion of defective items and find the acceptance probability in a fuzzy environment. This is an application of Birnbaum-Saunders distribution in fuzzy acceptance sampling.

AB Birnbaum and Saunders introduced a two-parameter lifetime distribution to model the fatigue life of a metal, subject to cyclic stress. Since then, extensive work has been done on this model providing different interpretations, constructions, generalizations, inferential methods, and extensions to bivariate, multivariate, and matrix-variate cases. More than 200 papers and one research monograph have already appeared describing all these aspects and developments. In this paper, we provide a detailed review of all these developments and, at the same time, indicate several open problems that could be considered for further research.

AB This paper provides the distribution of order statistics from a multivariate Birnbaum-Saunders (GMBS) distribution which can be used in the reliability and lifetime analyses. Proposing a new generalization of Birnbaum-Saunders distribution based on the unified skew-elliptical model, some properties of the order statistics are also studied.

AB bicoid is a maternally transcribed gene which plays a pivotal role during the early developmental stage of Drosophila melanogaster by acting as an essential input to the segmentation network. Therefore, fundamental insights into gene cross-regulations of segmentation network expect to be unveiled by presenting an accurate mathematical model for bicoid gene expression profile. In this paper, an extended version of Bimbaum-Saunders with four parameters is introduced and evaluated to describe the spatial gradient of this gene. Theoretical aspects of four-parameter Bimbaum-Saunders and the estimated parameters are presented and thoroughly assessed for different embryos. The reliability and validity of the results are evaluated via both simulation studies and real data sets and thereby adding more confidence and value to the findings of this research.

AB Cure rate models have been widely studied to analyze time-to-event data with a cured fraction of patients. Our proposal consists of incorporating frailty into a cure rate model, as an alternative to the existing models to describe this type of data, based on the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution. Such a distribution has theoretical arguments to model medical data and has shown empirically to be a good option for their analysis. An advantage of the proposed model is the possibility to jointly consider the heterogeneity among patients by their frailties and the presence of a cured fraction of them. In addition, the number of competing causes is described by the negative binomial distribution, which absorbs several particular cases. We consider likelihood-based methods to estimate the model parameters and to derive influence diagnostics for this model. We assess local influence on the parameter estimates under different perturbation schemes. Deriving diagnostic tools is needed in all statistical modeling, which is another novel aspect of our proposal. Numerical evaluation of the considered model is performed by Monte Carlo simulations and by an illustration with melanoma data, both of which show its good performance and its potential applications. Particularly, the illustration confirms the importance of statistical diagnostics in the modeling.

ID FAMILY
AB In this paper, a generalization of the modified slash Birnbaum-Saunders (BS) distribution is introduced. The model is defined by using the stochastic representation of the BS distribution, where the standard normal distribution is replaced by a symmetric distribution proposed by Reyes et al. It is proved that this new distribution is able to model more kurtosis than other extensions of BS previously proposed in the literature. Closed expressions are given for the pdf (probability density functio), along with their moments, skewness and kurtosis coefficients. Inference carried out is based on modified moments method and maximum likelihood (ML). To obtain ML estimates, two approaches are considered: Newton-Raphson and EM-algorithm. Applications reveal that it has potential for doing well in real problems.

AB Tubular DK-joints are among the most common joint types in jacket substructure of offshore wind turbines (OWTs) and oil/gas production platforms. The local joint flexibility (LJF), as an intrinsic feature of a tubular joint, is one of the factors affecting the global static and dynamic responses of an offshore structure. In the present paper, a total of 324 finite element (FE) analyses were carried out on 81 FE models of two-planar tubular DK-joints under four types of in-plane bending (IPB) moment loads. Generated FE models were validated based on the available experimental data, FE results, and parametric equations. FE analysis results were used to develop a set of probability density functions (PDFs) for the LW factor (f(LJF)) in IPB-loaded DK-joints. Based on a parametric FE investigation, a sample database was prepared for the f(LJF) values and density histograms were generated for respective samples. Nine theoretical PDFs were fitted to the developed histograms and the maximum likelihood (ML) method was applied to evaluate the parameters of fitted PDFs. In each case, the Kolmogorov-Smimov and chi-squared tests were used to assess the goodness of fit. Finally, the Birnbaum Saunders model was proposed as the governing probability distribution function for the f(LJF). After substituting the values of estimated parameters, four fully defined PDFs were presented for the f(LJF) in two-planar tubular DK-joints under four types of IPB loading.

AB Survival models with frailty are used when additional data are non-available to explain the occurrence time of an event of interest. This non-availability may be considered as a random effect related to unobserved explanatory variables, or that cannot be measured, often attributed to environmental or genetic factors. We propose a survival model with frailty based on the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution. This distribution has been widely applied to lifetime data. The random effect is the frailty, which is assumed to follow the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution and introduced on the baseline hazard rate to control the unobservable heterogeneity of the patients. We use the maximum likelihood method to estimate the model parameters and evaluate its performance under different censoring proportions by a Monte Carlo simulation study. Two types of residuals are considered to assess the adequacy of the proposed model. Examples with uncensored and censored real-world data sets illustrate the potential applications of the proposed model.

AB The exponential-dispersion (ED) process is a generalized stochastic process, including Wiener, gamma, and inverse Gaussian processes as special cases. This paper studies the reliability evaluation problem for products based on the ED process with random effects and covariates. The expectation maximization algorithm is applied to estimate the parameters of the ED processes. The probability density functions, the cumulative distribution functions of the lifetime and the remaining useful life distributions of products are derived based on Birnbaum-Saunders distribution. Finally, two illustrative examples are presented to show the effectiveness of the developed methods.

AB Wind energy has been explored as a viable alternative to fossil fuels in many small island developing states such as those in the Caribbean for a long time. Central to evaluating the feasibility of any wind energy project is choosing the most appropriate wind speed model. This is a function of the metric used to assess the goodness of fit of the statistical models tested. This paper compares a number of common metrics then proposes an alternative to the application-blind statistical tools commonly used.Wind speeds at two locations are considered: Crown Point, Tobago; and Piarco, Trinidad. Hourly wind speeds over a 15-year period have been analyzed for both sites. The available data is modelled using the Birnbaum-Saunders, Exponential, Gamma, Generalized Extreme Value, Generalized Pareto, Nakagami, Normal, Rayleigh and Weibull probability distributions. The distributions were compared graphically and their parameters were estimated using maximum likelihood estimation. Goodness of fit was assessed using the normalised mean square error testing, Chi-squared testing, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, R-squared, Akaike information criteria and Bayesian information criteria tests and the distributions ranked. The distribution ranking varied widely depending on the test used highlighting the need for a more contextualized goodness of fit metric. With this in mind, the concept of application-specific information criteria (ASIC) for testing goodness of fit is introduced. This allows distributions to be ranked by secondary features which are a function of both the primary data and the application space.

AB Geostatistical modelling is widely used to describe data with spatial dependence structure. Such modelling often assumes a Gaussian distribution, an assumption which is frequently violated due to the asymmetric nature of variables in diverse applications. The Birnbaum-Saunders distribution is asymmetrical and has several appealing properties, including theoretical arguments for describing chemical data. This work examines a Birnbaum-Saunders spatial regression model and derives global and local diagnostic methods to assess the influence of atypical observations on the maximum likelihood estimates of its parameters. Modelling and diagnostic methods are then applied to experimental data describing the spatial distribution of magnesium and calcium in the soil in the Parana state of Brazil. This application shows the importance of such a diagnostic analysis in spatial modelling with chemical data.

AB Spatial models to describe dependent georeferenced data are applied in different fields and, particularly, are used to analyze earth and environmental data. Most of these applications are carried out under Gaussian spatial models. The Birnbaum-Saunders distribution is a unimodal and positively skewed model which has received considerable attention in several areas, including earth and environmental sciences. In addition, theoretical arguments have been provided to justify its usage in the data modeling from these sciences, at least in the same settings where the lognormal distribution can be employed. This paper presents kriging with external drift based on a Birnbaum-Saunders spatial model. The maximum likelihood method is considered to estimate its parameters. The results obtained in the paper are illustrated by an experimental data set related to agricultural management. Specifically, in this illustration, the spatial variability of magnesium content in the soil as a function of calcium content is analyzed.

This family includes the shifted Wald distribution and a shifted version of the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution. Although the former has been proposed as a way to model reaction time data, the latter has not. Hence, we provide theoretical, mathematical and practical arguments in support of the shifted Birnbaum-Saunders as a suitable model of simple reaction times and associated cognitive mechanisms.

AB In this paper a new probability distribution supported on unit interval is introduced. This distribution arises from the Birnbaum and Saunders distribution. It depends on two parameters and can be considered as an alternative to the classical Beta distribution and Kumaraswamy distribution. It presents the advantage of not including any additional parameter(s) or special function in its formulation and it has closed-form for the moments. The new transformed model, called the unit-Birnbaum-Saunders (UBS) distribution exhibits decreasing, upside down bathtub and then bathtub shaped density while the hazard rate function can be increaseing or bathtub shaped. The method of maximum likelihood and moments are used to estimate the model parameters. Monte Carlo simulation is carried out to examine the bias and root mean squared error of the maximum likelihood and moment estimators of the parameters. Finally, the potentiality of the model is studied using two real data sets.

AB Cluster failure time data are commonly encountered in survival analysis due to different factors such as shared environmental conditions and genetic similarity. In such cases, careful attention needs to be paid to the correlation among subjects within same clusters. In this paper, we study a frailty model based on Birnbaum Saunders frailty distribution. We approximate the intractable integrals in the likelihood function by the use of Monte Carlo simulations and then use the piecewise constant baseline hazard function within the proportional hazards model in frailty framework. Thereafter, the maximum likelihood estimates are numerically determined. A simulation study is conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed model and the method of inference. Finally, we apply this model to a real data set to analyze the effect of sublingual nitroglycerin and oral isosorbide dinitrate on angina pectoris of coronary heart disease patients and compare our results with those based on other frailty models considered earlier in the literature.

AB We address the issue of performing inference on the parameters that index a bimodal extension of the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution (BS). We show that maximum likelihood point estimation can be problematic since the standard nonlinear optimization algorithms may fail to converge. To deal with this problem, we penalize the log-likelihood function. The numerical evidence we present shows that maximum likelihood estimation based on such penalized function is made considerably more reliable. We also consider hypothesis testing inference based on the penalized log-likelihood function. In particular, we consider likelihood ratio, signed likelihood ratio, score and Wald tests. Bootstrap-based testing inference is also considered. We use a nonnested hypothesis test to distinguish between two bimodal BS laws. We derive analytical corrections to some tests. Monte Carlo simulation results and empirical applications are presented and discussed. (C) 2017 International Association for Mathematics and Computers in Simulation (IMACS).

Our approach considers the BS-PE kernel estimator and treats locally the bandwidth h as a parameter with prior distribution. The posterior density of h at each point x (point where the density is estimated) is derived in closed form, and the Bayesian bandwidth selector is obtained by using popular loss functions. The performance evaluation of this new procedure is carried out by a simulation study and real data in web-traffic. The proposed method is very quick and very competitive in comparison with the existing global methods, namely biased cross-validation and unbiased cross-validation.

AB Since its origins and numerous applications in material science, the Birnbaum-Saunders family of distributions has now found widespread uses in some areas of the applied sciences such as agriculture, environment and medicine, as well as in quality control, among others. It is able to model varied data behaviour and hence provides a flexible alternative to the most usual distributions. The family includes Birnbaum-Saunders and log-Birnbaum-Saunders distributions in univariate and multivariate versions. There are now well-developed methods for estimation and diagnostics that allow in-depth analyses. This paper gives a detailed review of existing methods and of relevant literature, introducing properties and theoretical results in a systematic way. To emphasise the range of suitable applications, full analyses are included of examples based on regression and diagnostics in material science, spatial data modelling in agricultural engineering and control charts for environmental monitoring. However, potential future uses in new areas such as business, economics, finance and insurance are also discussed. This work is presented to provide a full tool-kit of novel statistical models and methods to encourage other researchers to implement them in these new areas. It is expected that the methods will have the same positive impact in the new areas as they have had elsewhere.

AB The classical Birnbaum Saunders (BS) distribution haS recently been generalized in various ways to introduce flexible parametric models for nonnegative data, focusing on the parametric fitting. In this paper, a new symmetrical-based inverse/reciprocal inverse Gaussian density, through dual transformation, is applied to the context of nonparametric density estimation for nonnegative data. The beauty and importance of new density estimator lies in its general formulation via the density generator, including a log-symmetrical kernel density estimator. We provide sufficient conditions under which the proposed estimator has desirable asymptotic properties, and discuss the asymptotic comparison between the proposed estimator and the previous (normal-based) estimator.

AB Understanding patterns in the frequency of extreme natural events, such as earthquakes, is important as it helps in the prediction of their future occurrence and hence provides better civil protection. Distributions describing these events are known to be heavy tailed and positive skew making standard distributions unsuitable for modelling the frequency of such events. The Birnbaum-Saunders distribution and its extreme value version have been widely studied and applied due to their attractive properties. We derive L-moment equations for these distributions and propose novel methods for parameter estimation, goodness-of-fit assessment and model selection. A simulation study is conducted to evaluate the performance of the L-moment estimators, which is compared to that of the maximum likelihood estimators, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed methods. To illustrate these methods in a practical application, a data analysis of real-world earthquake magnitudes, obtained from the global centroid moment tensor catalogue during 1962-2015, is carried out. This application identifies the extreme value Birnbaum-Saunders distribution as a better model than classic extreme value distributions for describing seismic events.

AB In this paper, we propose a multiple deferred state repetitive group sampling plan which is a new sampling plan developed by incorporating the features of both multiple deferred state sampling plan and repetitive group sampling plan, for assuring Weibull or gamma distributed mean life of the products. The quality of the product is represented by the ratio of true mean life and specified mean life of the products. Two points on the operating characteristic curve approach is used to determine the optimal parameters of the proposed plan. The plan parameters are determined by formulating an optimization problem for various combinations ofproducer's risk and consumer's risk for both distributions. The sensitivity analysis of the proposed plan is discussed. The implementation of the proposed plan is explained using real-life data and simulated data. The proposed plan under Weibull distribution is compared with the existing sampling plans. The average sample number (ASN) of the proposed plan and failure probability of the product are obtained under Weibull, gamma and Birnbaum-Saunders distributions for a specified value of shape parameter and compared with each other. In addition, a comparative study is made between the ASN of the proposed plan under Weibull and gamma distributions.

The theoretical properties are derived, and easily implemented Monte Carlo simulation schemes are presented. An inferential study is performed for the Laplace distribution.

AB According to the physical and orbital characteristics in Carme group, Ananke group, and Pasiphae group of Jupiter's moons, the distributions of physical and orbital properties in these three groups are investigated by using one-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov nonparametric test. Eight key characteristics of the moons are found to mainly obey the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution, logistic distribution, Weibull distribution, and t location-scale distribution. Furthermore, for the moons' physical and orbital properties, the probability density curves of data distributions are generated; the differences of three groups are also demonstrated. Based on the inferred results, one can predict some physical or orbital features of moons with missing data or even new possible moons within a reasonable range. In order to better explain the feasibility of the theory, a specific example is illustrated. Therefore, it is helpful to predict some of the properties of Jupiter's moons that have not yet been discovered with the obtained theoretical distribution inference.

AB Time series models based on the Birnbaum- Saunders ( BS) distribution have not received much attention in the literature, there being only a few articles that address such models. In the present paper, we propose a generalized autoregressive score ( GAS) model based on a bimodal Birnbaum- Saunders law. The proposed model, denoted by GBS2- GAS, generalizes an existing time series BS model. We discuss conditional maximum likelihood parameter estimation, hypothesis testing inference, residual analysis and develop prediction intervals for the GBS2- GAS model. Additionally, we provide analytical expressions for the score vector and for the Hessian matrix. Two empirical applications, involving financial and hydrological data, are presented and discussed.

AB Birnbaum-Saunders fatigue life distribution is an important failure model in the probability physical methods. It is more suitable for describing the life rules of fatigue failure products than common life distributions such as Weibull distribution and lognormal distribution. Besides, it is mainly applied to analytical research about fatigue failure and degradation failure of electronic product performance. The characteristic properties such as numerical characteristics and image features of density function and failure rate function are studied for generalized BS fatigue life distribution GBS(, , m) in this paper. Then the point estimates and approximate interval estimates of parameters are proposed for generalized BS fatigue life distribution GBS(, , m), and the precision of estimates are investigated by Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, when the scale parameter satisfies inverse power law model, the failure distribution model is given for the products of two-parameter BS fatigue life distribution BS(, ) under progressive stress accelerated life test according to the time conversion idea of famous Nelson assumption, and then the points estimates of parameters are given.

ID MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; SCALE MIXTURES; ALGORITHM; MODELS
AB We propose here a robust multivariate extension of the bivariate Birnbaum-Saunders (BS) distribution derived by Kundu et al. [Bivariate Birnbaum-Saunders distribution and associated inference. J Multivariate Anal. 2010;101:113-125], based on scale mixtures of normal (SMN) distributions that are used for modelling symmetric data. This resulting multivariate BS-type distribution is an absolutely continuous distribution whose marginal and conditional distributions are of BS-type distribution of Balakrishnan et al. [Estimation in the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution based on scalemixture of normals and the EM algorithm. Stat Oper Res Trans. 2009;33:171-192]. Due to the complexity of the likelihood function, parameter estimation by direct maximization is very difficult to achieve. For this reason, we exploit the nice hierarchical representation of the proposed distribution to propose a fast and accurate EM algorithm for computing the maximum likelihood (ML) estimates of the model parameters. We then evaluate the finite-sample performance of the developed EM algorithm and the asymptotic properties of the ML estimates through empirical experiments. Finally, we illustrate the obtained results with a real data and display the robustness feature of the estimation procedure developed here.

AB The tobit model allows a censored response variable to be described by covariates. Its applications cover different areas such as economics, engineering, environment and medicine. A strong assumption of the standard tobit model is that its errors follow a normal distribution. However, not all applications are well modeled by this distribution. Some efforts have relaxed the normality assumption by considering more flexible distributions. Nevertheless, the presence of asymmetry could not be well described by these flexible distributions. A real-world data application of measles vaccine in Haiti is explored, which confirms this asymmetry. We propose a tobit model with errors following a Birnbaum-Saunders (BS) distribution, which is asymmetrical and has shown to be a good alternative for describing medical data. Inference based on the maximum likelihood method and a type of residual are derived for the tobit-BS model. We perform global and local influence diagnostics to assess the sensitivity of the maximum likelihood estimators to atypical cases. A Monte Carlo simulation study is carried out to empirically evaluate the performance of these estimators. We conduct a data analysis for the mentioned application of measles vaccine based on the proposed model with the help of the R software. The results show the good performance of the tobit-BS model.

AB In this paper, we discuss stochastic comparisons of minima and maxima arising from heterogeneous bivariate Birnbaum-Saunders (BS) random vectors with respect to the usual stochastic order based on vector majorization of parameters. Suppose the bivariate random vectors (X-1, X-2) and (X-1*, X-2*) follow BVBS(alpha(1), beta(1), alpha(2), beta(2),rho) and BVBS(alpha(1)*, beta(1)*, alpha(2)*, beta(2)*,rho) distributions, respectively. Suppose 0 < nu <= 2. We then prove that when alpha(1) = alpha(2) = alpha(1)* = alpha(2)*, (beta(1)*(-1/nu),beta(2)*(-1/nu)) implies X-2: 2* >= st X-1: 2* >= st X-1: 2. These results are subsequently generalized to a wider range of scale parameters. Next, we prove that when beta(1) = beta(2) = beta(1)* = beta(2)*, (1/alpha(1), 1/alpha(2)) >= m (1/alpha(1)*, 1/alpha(2)*) implies X-2: 2 >= st X-2: 2* and X-1: 2 * >= st X-1: 2. Analogous results are then deduced for bivariate log BS distributions as well.

AB Let X-1,..., X-n be lifetimes of components with independent non-negative generalized Birnbaum-Saunders random variables with shape parameters alpha(i) and scale parameters beta(i), i = 1,..., n, and I-p1,..., I-pn be independent Bernoulli random variables, independent of X-i's, with E(I-pi) = p(i), i = 1,..., n. These are associated with random shocks on X-i's. Then, Y-i = I-pi X-i, i = 1,..., n, correspond to the lifetimes when the random shock does not impact the components and zero when it does. In this paper, we discuss stochastic comparisons of the smallest order statistic arising from such random variables Y-i, i = 1,..., n. When the matrix of parameters (h(p), beta(1/nu).) or (h(p), 1/alpha) changes to another matrix of parameters in a certain mathematical sense, we study the usual stochastic order of the smallest order statistic in such a setup. Finally, we apply the established results to two special cases: classical Birnbaum- Saunders and logistic Birnbaum- Saunders distributions.

AB Multivariate control charts are powerful and simple visual tools for monitoring the quality of a process. This multivariate monitoring is carried out by considering simultaneously several correlated quality characteristics and by determining whether these characteristics are in control or out of control. In this paper, we propose a robust methodology using multivariate quality control charts for subgroups based on generalized Birnbaum-Saunders distributions and an adapted Hotelling statistic. This methodology is constructed for Phases I and II of control charts. We estimate the corresponding parameters with the maximum likelihood method and use parametric bootstrapping to obtain the distribution of the adapted Hotelling statistic. In addition, we consider the Mahalanobis distance to detect multivariate outliers and use it to assess the adequacy of the distributional assumption. A Monte Carlo simulation study is conducted to evaluate the proposed methodology and to compare it with a standard methodology. This study reports the good performance of our methodology. An illustration with real-world air quality data of Santiago, Chile, is provided. This illustration shows that the methodology is useful for alerting early episodes of extreme air pollution, thus preventing adverse effects on human health.

AB Univariate Birnbaum-Saunders distribution has received a considerable attention in recent years. Rieck and Nedelman (Technometrics, vol. 33, 51-60, 1991) introduced a log Birnbaum-Saunders distribution. We introduce a multivariate log Birnbaum-Saunders distribution and discuss its different properties. It is observed that the proposed multivariate model can be obtained from the multivariate Gaussian copula. We have proposed the maximum likelihood estimators of the unknown parameters. Since it is a computationally challenging problem, particularly if the dimension is high, we have considered the approximate maximum likelihood estimators based on the Copula structure using two-step procedure. The asymptotic distributions of both these estimators have been obtained. We compare their performances using Monte Carlo simulations, and it is observed that their performances are very similar in nature. One data set has been analyzed for illustrative purposes.

AB Modeling components' thermal fatigue life due to cyclic temperature fluctuation based on Coffin-Mason principle has been extensively investigated. However, sparse research assesses the thermal fatigue life by providing the reliability metrics of components/systems under thermal fatigue. The Bimbaum-Saunders (BS) distribution is developed to model the unit's fatigue failure induced by mechanical stresses and provides the unit's reliability metrics. In this paper, we investigate a generalized Birnbaum-Saunders (GBS) distribution and its performance in predicting fatigue failure caused by thermal cyclic stresses. We then apply the GBS distribution to model the reliability metrics of a system with mixtures of nonhomogeneous one-shot units subject to thermal fatigue. An extensive simulation model is developed to validate the system reliability metrics accuracy. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the use of the models. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this paper, we introduce an extension for the Birnbaum-Saunders (BS) distribution based on the modified slash (MS) distribution proposed by [12]. This new family of BS type distributions is obtained by replacing the usual normal distribution with the quotient of two independent random variables, one being a normal distribution in the numerator and the power of a exponential of parameter equal to two at the denominator. The resulting distribution is an extension of the BS distribution that has greater kurtosis values than the usual BS distribution and the slash Birnbaum-Saunders (SBS) distribution (see [7]). Moments and some properties are derived for the new distribution. Also, we draw inferences by the method of moments and maximum likelihood. A real data application is presented where the model fitting is implemented by using maximum likelihood estimation producing better results than the classic BS model and slash BS model.

AB A family of scale-mixture of epsilon Birnbaum-Saunders (SEBS) distributions is introduced and studied. This new family is based on the epsilon-skew-normal (ESN) distribution and provides more flexibility in terms of skewness and kurtosis (heavy tails). We discuss some of its probabilistic and inferential properties. We perform maximum likelihood estimation by the use of EM algorithm and then evaluate the performance of the estimators through a Monte Carlo simulation study. A bias-reduction method is suggested for reducing the bias of some estimators. Finally, the analysis of two data sets is performed for illustrative purposes.

AB In accelerated degradation testing (ADT), test data from higher than normal stress conditions are used to find stochastic models of degradation, e.g., Wiener process, Gamma process, and inverse Gaussian process models. In general, the selection of the degradation model is made with reference to one specific product and no consideration is given to model uncertainty. In this paper, we address this issue and apply the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) method to constant stress ADT. For illustration, stress relaxation ADT data are analyzed. We also make a simulation study to compare the s-credibility intervals for single model and BMA. The results show that degradation model uncertainty has significant effects on the p-quantile lifetime at the use conditions, especially for extreme quantiles. The BMA can well capture this uncertainty and compute compromise s-credibility intervals with the highest coverage probability at each quantile.

AB In this paper the sinh-power model is developed as a natural follow up to the log-linear Birnbaum-Saunders power model. The class of models resulting, incorporates the sinh-power-normal model, the ordinary sinh-normal model and the log-linear Birnbaum-Saunders model (Rieck and Nedelman, Technometrics 33:51-60, 1991). Maximum likelihood estimation is developed with the Hessian matrix used for standard error estimation. An application is reported for the data set on lung cancer studied in Kalbfleisch and Prentice (2002), where it is shown that the log-linear Birnbaum-Saunders power-normal model presents better fit than the log-linear Birnbaum-Saunders model. Another application is devoted to a fatigue data set previously analyzed in the literature. A nonlinear Birnbaum-Saunders power-normal model is fitted to the data set, with satisfactory performance.

AB This paper deals with the issue of testing hypotheses in symmetric and log-symmetric linear regression models in small and moderate-sized samples. We focus on four tests, namely, the Wald, likelihood ratio, score, and gradient tests. These tests rely on asymptotic results and are unreliable when the sample size is not large enough to guarantee a good agreement between the exact distribution of the test statistic and the corresponding chi-squared asymptotic distribution. Bartlett and Bartlett-type corrections typically attenuate the size distortion of the tests. These corrections are available in the literature for the likelihood ratio and score tests in symmetric linear regression models. Here, we derive a Bartlett-type correction for the gradient test. We show that the corrections are also valid for the log-symmetric linear regression models. We numerically compare the various tests and bootstrapped tests, through simulations. Our results suggest that the corrected and bootstrapped tests exhibit type I probability error closer to the chosen nominal level with virtually no power loss. The analytically corrected tests as well as the bootstrapped tests, including the Bartlett-corrected gradient test derived in this paper, perform with the advantage of not requiring computationally intensive calculations. We present a real data application to illustrate the usefulness of the modified tests.

AB Cutaneous melanoma is thought to be triggered by intense, occasional exposure to ultraviolet radiation, either from the sun or tanning beds, especially in people who are genetically predisposed to the disease. When skin cells are damaged by ultraviolet light in this way, often showing up as a sunburn, they are more prone to genetic defects that cause them to rapidly multiply and form potentially fatal (malignant) tumors. Melanoma originates in a type of skin cell called a melanocyte, such cells help produce the pigments of our skin, hair, and eyes. We propose a new cure rate survival regression model for predicting cutaneous melanoma. We assume that the unknown number of competing causes that can influence the survival time is governed by a power series distribution and that the time until the tumor cells are activated follows the Pareto IV distribution. The parameter estimation is based on the EM algorithm which for this model can be implemented in a simple way in computational terms. Simulation studies are presented, showing the good performance of the proposed estimation procedure. Finally, two real applications related to a cutaneous melanoma and melanoma data sets are presented.

ID LIFE DISTRIBUTIONS; FAMILY; VERSION
AB The Birnbaum-Saunders (BS) model is a fatigue life distribution related to the normal one with appealing properties. It is a non-negative transformation of a N(0,1) random variable Z, and its extended version, the so-called generalized Birnbaum-Saunders (GBS) model, obtained replacing Z by any other symmetric continuous random variable, shares the same properties. In this paper we characterize the GBS distribution according to one of its outstanding properties and take advantage of this characterization to derive a graphical procedure to assess whether an observed data set follows a GBS distribution. We further develop a goodness-of-fit test for the hypothesis that the data follow a BS distribution with unknown parameters and apply the results to real data sets.

We derive some properties of the new distribution that include expressions for the ordinary moments and generating and quantile functions. The method of maximum likelihood and a Bayesian approach are adopted to estimate the model parameters; in addition, various simulations are performed for different parameter settings and sample sizes. We propose two new models with a cure rate called the odd Birnbaum-Saunders mixture and odd Birnbaum-Saunders geometric models by assuming that the number of competing causes for the event of interest has a geometric distribution. The applicability of the new models are illustrated by means of ethylene data and melanoma data with cure fraction.

AB A knowledge of wind speed and wind power probability distributions is important for several reasons such as assessing wind resources, planning wind farms and minimizing the uncertainties for wind power development. In this study, application of the two parameter Birnbaum-Saunders (BS) distribution is introduced and reviewed for characterizing the wind speed and wind power density distributions. For this work, a long-term time series of measured wind speed data for ten stations distributed in the Ontario province of Canada has been utilized for a case study. The suitability of the BS distribution was evaluated against nine earlier used one-component distributions. The results showed that BS distribution performed very favorably at all selected stations. It outperformed the other distributions at six stations while in the remaining four stations ranked either third or fourth. It was also found that, although the Weibull distribution was the second best function to estimate the wind power density distribution, it was not able to give adequate description of the frequency of wind speed data at all sites. In summary, the study results demonstrated the generalization capability, precision, and effectiveness of the BS distribution for characterizing wind speed and wind power distribution.

AB In this paper, the interest is in estimating the fatigue life distribution of highly reliable structural components from data obtained via accelerated life tests. These tests consist in subjecting the products of interest to stress levels more severe than those encountered in normal use. This forces the considered products to fail more quickly and allows collecting failure data in a reasonably short amount of time. Estimates of the product's reliability at normal use conditions are then extrapolated from accelerated failure data by adopting proper models. The model proposed in this paper generalizes a model which is widely applied in literature to analyze accelerated fatigue life data. In fact, as the abovementioned standard model it relies on two very classical assumptions, namely: a) the test conditions affect the lifetime distribution parameters, and not its form, and b) the fatigue life at each considered stress level follows a Birnbaum-Saunders distribution. On the other side, differently from the standard model, in which only the scale parameter depends on the stress conditions, the proposed model assumes that both the parameters of the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution possibly depend on the stress. The model is applied to a real set of accelerated fatigue failure data. Model parameters are estimated via the maximum likelihood method. The estimate of the reliability function at normal use conditions is extrapolated from the accelerated data. It is shown that the proposed Birnbaum-Saunders based model, in which both scale and shape parameters depend on the stress conditions, fits the considered data better than the model usually adopted in the literature. Differences among results provided by the two considered alternative models are highlighted and discussed. Finally two graphical strategies are proposed that allow judging the goodness of fit of the proposed model in absolute terms. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We studied the problem of testing a hypothesized distribution in survival regression models when the data is right censored and survival times are influenced by covariates. A modified chi-squared type test, known as Nikulin-Rao-Robson statistic, is applied for the comparison of accelerated failure time models. This statistic is used to test the goodness-of-fit for hypertabastic survival model and four other unimodal hazard rate functions. The results of simulation study showed that the hypertabastic distribution can be used as an alternative to log-logistic and log-normal distribution. In statistical modeling, because of its flexible shape of hazard functions, this distribution can also be used as a competitor of Birnbaum-Saunders and inverse Gaussian distributions. The results for the real data application are shown. Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The proposed moment-type estimators are easy to compute and always exist uniquely. We derive the asymptotic distributions of these estimators and carry out a simulation study to evaluate the performance of all these estimators. The probability coverages of confidence intervals are also discussed. Finally, two examples are used to illustrate the proposed methods.

AB In survival models, some covariates affecting the lifetime could not be observed or measured. These covariates may correspond to environmental or genetic factors and be considered as a random effect related to a frailty of the individuals explaining their survival times. We propose a methodology based on a Birnbaum-Saunders frailty regression model, which can be applied to censored or uncensored data. Maximum-likelihood methods are used to estimate the model parameters and to derive local influence techniques. Diagnostic tools are important in regression to detect anomalies, as departures from error assumptions and presence of outliers and influential cases. Normal curvatures for local influence under different perturbations are computed and two types of residuals are introduced. Two examples with uncensored and censored real-world data illustrate the proposed methodology. Comparison with classical frailty models is carried out in these examples, which shows the superiority of the proposed model.

AB In life testing, the competing risks model is usually discussed under the assumption of independence. In this paper, we consider a dependent competing risks model using bivariate Birnbaum-Saunders distribution in constant-stress accelerated life testing. To observe expected failure times and terminate the life tests around a predetermined time, the adaptive progressively hybrid censoring scheme is adopted. Based on the accelerated competing risks model with the adaptive progressively hybrid censoring scheme, we obtain the maximum-likelihood estimators, approximate confidence intervals, and bootstrap confidence intervals of unknown parameters. To test the independence between the bivariate competing risks and find the relationship of shape and scale parameters, we discuss the likelihood ratio tests for hypotheses of interest. In addition, we compute the maximum-likelihood predictors of unobserved competing risks times in the constant-stress accelerated life tests. Finally, a simulation study and an illustrative example are provided to support the proposed model and methods, and to examine the performance of estimators and testing.

AB We evaluated the usefulness of ten theoretical probability density functions for the approximation of the breast height diameter distributions in managed alder stands growing in the western part of the Sandomierz Basin (southern Poland). The study material consisted of measurement results for 22,530 alders obtained for 844 circular sample plots, established in 163 stands aged 6-89. In the area of particular stands, from 2 to 10 age-dependent circular sample plots sized 0.01-0.10 ha were systematically arranged. We evaluated the following theoretical probability distributions: normal (N), double normal (P-N), Johnson S-B (J), Weibull (W), beta (B), Burr (Bu), gamma (G), log-normal (L-N), log-logistic (L-L) and Birnbaum-Saunders (B-S). Additionally the usefulness of the W, B, Bu, G, L-N, L-L and B-S distributions with omitted location parameter was tested. The goodness-of-fit of each probability density function was assessed based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic, the root mean square error and ranks established on their basis. It was found that DBH distribution of majority stands is characterized by right-sided asymmetry and negative kurtosis. It was showed that the best distribution for the breast height diameter structure approximation of alder stands is the Johnson SB (J) distribution. To describe the frequency of thickness, normal (N) and log-logistic (L-L) distribution should not be used. Elimination of location parameter significantly affects usefulness of probability density functions to modeling empirical distributions of breast height diameter. Gamma and Burr distributions with omitted location parameter gave the best results in description the frequency of breast height diameter. In certain situations, these distributions can also be used to describe the structure of breast height diameter of alder stands.

AB Cooray and Ananda (2008) pioneered a lifetime model commonly used in reliability studies. Based on this distribution, we propose a new model called the odd log-logistic generalized half-normal distribution for describing fatigue lifetime data. Various of its structural properties are derived. We discuss the method of maximum likelihood to fit the model parameters. For different parameter settings and sample sizes, some simulation studies compare the performance of the new lifetime model. It can be very useful, and its superiority is illustrated by means of a real dataset.

AB This paper presents a new finite mixture model using the normal mean variance mixture of Birnbaum-Saunders distribution. The proposed model is multi modal with wider ranges of skewness and kurtosis. Moreover, it is useful for modeling highly asymmetric data in various theoretical and applied statistical problems. The maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of the model are computed iteratively by feasible EM algorithm. To illustrate the finite sample properties and performance of the estimators, we conduct a simulation study and illustrate the usefulness of the new model by analyzing a real dataset.

AB This study aimed to initiate, implement and validate a project to build a computerized system to adjust probability density functions. The FitFD was developed using the Java programming language. IDE (Integrated Development Environment) NetBeans 7.1 and JDK 7.3 (Java Development Kit) were used as the development environment. The system was tested in Windows. The following probability density functions were implemented in the system: Weibull (2P, 3P, 2P with minimum dbh, truncated 3P), hyperbolic (2P, 3P, 2P with minimum dbh, truncated 3P), Log-logistic (2P, 3P, 2P with minimum dbh), Logistics Generalized, Fatigue Life (2P and 3P) and Frechet (2P and 3P). The system developed assists users in defining and choosing fdp that best meet their needs, however improvements are needed. The project proved efficient for adjustments of probability density functions.

AB Scale mixtures of Birnbaum-Saunders (SBS) distributions are attractive models in lifetime analysis. These models are based on scale mixture of normal (SMN) distributions and provide flexible heavy-tailed distributions. In this article, we propose a skewed version of SBS distributions and we establish some of its probabilistic and inferential properties. We then discuss the maximum likelihood estimation of the model parameters. An illustration of the methodology is provided, using real data.

This new family of distributions holds good properties such as marginal variables following univariate skewed log-Birnbaum-Saunders distributions, besides presenting the usual log-Birnbaum-Saunders distribution as a particular case. Furthermore, the model parameters are estimated through maximum-likelihood methods, a closed-form expression for the Fisher's information matrix is presented, and testing hypothesis for model parameters is performed. Two real datasets are analyzed and results are discussed.

AB Sinh-normal/independent distributions are a class of symmetric heavy-tailed distributions that include the sinh-normal distribution as a special case, which has been used extensively in Birnbaum-Saunders regression models. Here, we explore the use of Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to develop a Bayesian analysis in nonlinear regression models when Sinh-normal/independent distributions are assumed for the random errors term, and it provides a robust alternative to the sinh-normal nonlinear regression model. Bayesian mechanisms for parameter estimation, residual analysis and influence diagnostics are then developed, which extend the results of Farias and Lemonte [Bayesian inference for the Birnbaum-Saunders nonlinear regression model, Stat. Methods Appl. 20 (2011), pp. 423-438] who used the Sinh-normal/independent distributions with known scale parameter. Some special cases, based on the sinh-Student-t (sinh-St), sinh-slash (sinh-SL) and sinh-contaminated normal (sinh-CN) distributions are discussed in detail. Two real datasets are finally analyzed to illustrate the developed procedures.

AB We present a Bayesian approach for parameter inference of the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution [Birnbaum ZW, Saunders SC. A new family of life distributions. J Appl Probab. 1969;6:319-327], as well as the generalized Birnbaum-Saunders distribution developed by Owen [A new three-parameter extension to the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution. IEEE Trans Reliab. 2006;55:475-479], in the presence of random right-censored data. To handle the instance of commonly occurred censored observations, we utilize the data augmentation technique [Tanner MA, Wong WH. The calculation of posterior distributions by data augmentation. J Amer Statist Assoc. 1987;82(398):528-540] to circumvent the arduous expressions involving the censored data in posterior inferences. Simulation studies are carried out to assess performance of these methods under different parameter values, with small and large sample sizes, as well as various degrees of censoring. Two real data are analysed for illustrative purpose.

AB The log-Birnbaum-Saunders regression model introduced by Rieck and Nedelman (1991) is useful for modeling lifetimes of materials and equipments subject to different conditions. Our goal in this article is twofold. First, we numerically evaluate the finite sample performances of the likelihood ratio, score and Wald tests in the log-Birnbaum-Saunders regression model. Second, we introduce a RESET-like misspecification test for that model. The null hypothesis is that the model is correctly specified which is tested against the alternative hypothesis of model misspecification. The power of the test is evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations. Bootstrap-based inference is also considered. An empirical application is presented and discussed.

AB The main objective of this paper is to develop a full Bayesian analysis for the Birnbaum-Saunders (BS) regression model based on scale mixtures of the normal (SMN) distribution with right-censored survival data. The BS distributions based on SMN models are a very general approach for analysing lifetime data, which has as special cases the Student-t-BS, slash-BS and the contaminated normal-BS distributions, being a flexible alternative to the use of the corresponding BS distribution or any other well-known compatible model, such as the log-normal distribution. A Gibbs sample algorithm with Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is used to obtain the Bayesian estimates of the parameters. Moreover, some discussions on the model selection to compare the fitted models are given and case-deletion influence diagnostics are developed for the joint posterior distribution based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence. The newly developed procedures are illustrated on a real data set previously analysed under BS regression models.

AB The Birnbaum-Saunders distribution is a widely used distribution in reliability applications to model failure times. For several samples from possible different Birnbaum-Saunders distributions, if their means can be considered as the same, it is of importance to make inference for the common mean. This paper presents procedures for interval estimation and hypothesis testing for the common mean of several Birnbaum-Saunders populations. The proposed approaches are hybrids between the generalized inference method and the large sample theory. Some simulation results are conducted to present the performance of the proposed approaches. The simulation results indicate that our proposed approaches perform well. Finally, the proposed approaches are applied to analyze a real example on the fatigue life of 6061-T6 aluminum coupons for illustration.

AB In this article, we introduce a new extension of the Birnbaum-Saunders (BS) distribution as a follow-up to the family of skew-flexible-normal distributions. This extension produces a family of BS distributions including densities that can be unimodal as well as bimodal. This flexibility is important in dealing with positive bimodal data, given the difficulties experienced by the use of mixtures of distributions. Some basic properties of the new distribution are studied including moments. Parameter estimation is approached by the method of moments and also by maximum likelihood, including a derivation of the Fisher information matrix. Three real data illustrations indicate satisfactory performance of the proposed model.

AB Applications of statistical models to describe spatial dependence in geo-referenced data are widespread across many disciplines including the environmental sciences. Most of these applications assume that the data follow a Gaussian distribution. However, in many of them the normality assumption, and even a more general assumption of symmetry, are not appropriate. In non-spatial applications, where the data are uni-modal and positively skewed, the Birnbaum-Saunders (BS) distribution has excelled. This paper proposes a spatial log-linear model based on the BS distribution. Model parameters are estimated using the maximum likelihood method. Local influence diagnostics are derived to assess the sensitivity of the estimators to perturbations in the response variable. As illustration, the proposed model and its diagnostics are used to analyse a real-world agricultural data set, where the spatial variability of phosphorus concentration in the soil is considered-which is extremely important for agricultural management.

AB The Birnbaum-Saunders distribution has been widely studied and applied to reliability studies. This paper proposes a novel use of this distribution to analyze the effect on hardness, a material mechanical property, when incorporating nano-particles inside a polymeric bone cement. A plain variety and two modified types of mesoporous silica nano-particles are considered. In biomaterials, one can study the effect of nano-particles on mechanical response reliability. Experimental data collected by the authors from a micro-indentation test about hardness of a commercially available polymeric bone cement are analyzed. Hardness is modeled with the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution and Bayesian inference is performed to derive a methodology, which allows us to evaluate the effect of using nano-particles at different loadings by the R software.

AB A simple integrate-and-fire mechanism of a single neuron can be compared with a cumulative damage process, where the spiking process is analogous to rupture sequences of a material under cycles of stress. Although in some cases lognormal-like patterns can be recognized in the inter-spike times under a simple integrate-and-fire mechanism, fatigue life models as the inverse Gaussian distribution and the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution (which was recently introduced in the neural activity framework) provide theoretical arguments that make them more suitable for the modeling of the resulting inter-spike times.

AB Birnbaum-Saunders (BS) models are receiving considerable attention in the literature. Multivariate regression models are a useful tool of the multivariate analysis, which takes into account the correlation between variables. Diagnostic analysis is an important aspect to be considered in the statistical modeling. In this paper, we formulate multivariate generalized BS regression models and carry out a diagnostic analysis for these models. We consider the Mahalanobis distance as a global influence measure to detect multivariate outliers and use it for evaluating the adequacy of the distributional assumption. We also consider the local influence approach and study how a perturbation may impact on the estimation of model parameters. We implement the obtained results in the R software, which are illustrated with real-world multivariate data to show their potential applications.

AB The Burr type X distribution is considered as a life time random variable of a product whose lots are to be decided for acceptance or otherwise on the basis of sample lifetimes drawn from the lot. The sample is divided into various groups in order to develop a group sampling plan in such a way that the life testing experiment is terminated as soon as the first failure in each group is observed. The acceptance criterion based on the theory of order statistics is proposed and is shown to be more economical than a criterion proposed in the earlier similar works.

AB We address the issue of performing testing inference in Birnbaum-Saunders nonlinear regression models when the sample size is small. The likelihood ratio, Wald and score statistics provide the basis for testing inference on the parameters in this class of models. We focus on the small-sample case, where the reference chi-squared distribution gives a poor approximation to the true null distribution of these test statistics. We derive a general Bartlett-type correction in matrix notation for the score test, which reduces the size distortion of the test, and numerically compare the proposed test with the usual likelihood ratio, Wald and score tests, and with the Bartlett-corrected likelihood ratio test, and bootstrap corrected tests. Our simulation results suggest that the proposed corrected test can be an interesting alternative to other tests since it leads to very accurate inference even for very small samples. We also present an empirical application for illustrative purposes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Series of observed flood intervals, defined as the time intervals between successive flood peaks over a threshold, were extracted directly from 11 approximately 100-year streamflow datasets from Queensland, Australia. A range of discharge thresholds were analysed that correspond to return periods of approximately 3.7 months to 6.3 years. Flood interval histograms at South East Queensland gauges were consistently unimodal whereas those of the North and Central Queensland sites were often multimodal. The exponential probability distribution (pd) is often used to describe interval exceedence probabilities, but fitting utilizing the Anderson-Darling statistic found little evidence that it is the most suitable. The fatigue life pd dominated sub-year return periods (<1 year), often transitioning to a log Pearson 3 pd at above-year return periods. Fatigue life pd is used in analysis of the lifetime to structural failure when a threshold is exceeded, and this paper demonstrates its relevance also to the elapsed time between above-threshold floods. At most sites, the interval medians were substantially less than the means for sub-year return periods. Statistically the median is a better measure of the central tendency of skewed distributions but the mean is generally used in practice to describe the classical concept of flood return period.

AB The Birnbaum-Saunders (BS) distribution is broadly used to model failure times in reliability and survival analysis. In this article, we propose a simultaneous parameter estimation and variable selection procedure in a log-linear BS regression model for high-dimensional survival data. To deal with censored survival data, we iteratively run a combination of the stochastic EM algorithm (SEM) and variable selection procedure to generate pseudo-complete data and select variables until convergence. Treating pseudo-complete data as uncensored data via SEM makes it possible to incorporate iterative penalized least squares and simplify computation.

AB Some matrix representations of diverse diagonal arrays are studied in this work; the results allow new definitions of classes of elliptical distributions indexed by kernels mixing Hadamard and usual products. A number of applications are derived in the setting of prior densities from the Bayesian multivariate regression model and families of non-elliptical distributions, such as the matrix multivariate generalized Birnbaum-Saunders density. The philosophy of the research about matrix representations of quadratic and inverse quadratic forms can be extended as a methodology for exploring possible new applications in non-standard distributions, matrix transformations and inference.

AB In this paper, we consider fiducial inference for the unknown parameters of the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution. Two generalized fiducial distributions of the parameters are obtained. One is based on the inverse of the structural equation, and the fiducial estimates of the parameters are obtained by a simulation method. The other is based on the method of [Hannig J. Generalized fiducial inference via discretization. Stat. Sinica. 2013;23:489-514], then we use adaptive rejection Metropolis sampling to get the fiducial estimates. We compare the fiducial estimates with the maximum likelihood estimates and Bayesian estimates by simulations. Two real data sets are analysed for illustration.

We propose and derive new multivariate generalized Birnbaum-Saunders regression models. We use the maximum likelihood method and the EM algorithm to estimate their parameters. We carry out a simulation study to evaluate the performance of the corresponding maximum likelihood estimators. We illustrate the new models with real-world multivariate fatigue data.

AB Statistical estimation of the model parameters of component lifetime distribution based on system lifetime data with known system structure is discussed here. We propose the use of stochastic expectation-maximization (SEM) algorithm for obtaining the maximum likelihood estimates of model parameters based on complete and censored system lifetimes. Different ways of implementing the SEM algorithm are also studied. We have shown that the proposed methods are feasible and are easy to implement for various families of component lifetime distributions. The proposed methodologies are then illustrated with two popular lifetime models-the Weibull and Birnbaum-Saunders distributions. Monte Carlo simulation is then used to compare the performance of the proposed methods with the corresponding estimation by direct maximization. Finally, two illustrative examples are presented along with some concluding remarks.

AB The Birnbaum-Saunders distribution is widely used in fields such as survival analysis. In this paper, we use a new method to construct confidence intervals for the shape parameter of the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution and find it superior to some existing methods. Our method can be called the "joint pivot method" as we obtain the confidence interval by uniting two pivots. Furthermore, we find that the joint pivot method can also be used to solve the Behrens-Fisher problem. Simulation studies show that the joint pivot method is comparable with some commonly practiced ones. Finally, we analyse two real data sets to illustrate the proposed procedure.

AB Axon diameter is an important neuroanatomical characteristic of the nervous system that alters in the course of neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis. Axon diameters vary, even within a fiber bundle, and are not normally distributed. An accurate distribution function is therefore beneficial, either to describe axon diameters that are obtained from a direct measurement technique (e.g., microscopy), or to infer them indirectly (e.g., using diffusion-weighted MRI). The gamma distribution is a common choice for this purpose (particularly for the inferential approach) because it resembles the distribution profile of measured axon diameters which has been consistently shown to be non-negative and right-skewed. In this study we compared a wide range of parametric probability distribution functions against empirical data obtained from electron microscopy images. We observed that the gamma distribution fails to accurately describe the main characteristics of the axon diameter distribution, such as location and scale of the mode and the profile of distribution tails. We also found that the generalized extreme value distribution consistently fitted the measured distribution better than other distribution functions. This suggests that there may be distinct subpopulations of axons in the corpus callosum, each with their own distribution profiles. In addition, we observed that several other distributions outperformed the gamma distribution, yet had the same number of unknown parameters; these were the inverse Gaussian, log normal, log logistic and Birnbaum-Saunders distributions.

AB In these days, the online monitoring information which includes usage history, system conditions, and environmental conditions is reported. On statistical modeling, these variables from the online monitoring are primary candidates for covariates which affect the failure mechanism. There is some literature on modeling by the cumulative exposure model for a products lifetime distribution with covariate effects. Some existing literatures require an already known parametric baseline distribution of the cumulative exposure. However such knowledge may be difficult to acquire in advance in some cases. When an incorrect baseline distribution is assumed, it is called misspecification. A previous study proposed the strategy which use a likelihood function under a log-normal distribution to estimate parameters which represent covariate effects when the truly underlying baseline distribution is either a Weibull distribution or a log-normal distribution. In this time, this paper widens the range of application of the strategy using the likelihood function under a log-normal distribution to estimate parameters of covariate effects. On that account, the simulation study and the discussion for the bias of estimation are shown under a normal condition.

AB In this paper, we discuss stochastic comparisons of lifetimes of parallel and series systems with independent heterogeneous Birnbaum-Saunders components with respect to the usual stochastic order based on vector majorization of parameters. Specifically, let, X, be independent random variables with Xi PO, i = 1,..., n, and X-1, ... , X-n be another set of independent random variables with X-i similar to BS(alpha(i), beta(i)), i = 1, ... , n and X-1*, ..., X-n* be another set of independent random variables with X-i* similar to BS(alpha(*)(i), beta(i)*), i = 1,...n, Then, we first show that when alpha(1) = ... = alpha(n) = alpha(1)* = ... = scale parameters. Next, we show that when beta(1) = ... = beta(n) = beta(1)* = ... = beta(n)*, (1/alpha(1), ..., 1/alpha(n)) >= (1/alpha(1)*, ..., 1/alpha(n)*) implies X-n:n >= and X-1:n* >=(st) X-1:n. Finally, we establish similar results for the log Birnbaum Saunders distribution. (C) (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we study the main statistical properties of the class of log-symmetric distributions, which includes as special cases bimodal distributions as well as distributions that have heavier/ lighter tails than those of the log-normal distribution. This family includes distributions such as the log-normal, log-Student-t, harmonic law, Birnbaum-Saunders, Birnbaum-Saunders-t and generalized Birnbaum-Saunders. We derive quantile-based measures of location, dispersion, skewness, relative dispersion and kurtosis for the log-symmetric class that are appropriate in the context of asymmetric and heavy-tailed distributions. Additionally, we discuss parameter estimation based on both classical and Bayesian approaches. The usefulness of the log-symmetric class is illustrated through a statistical analysis of a real dataset, in which the performance of the log-symmetric class is compared with that of some competitive and very flexible distributions.

AB In this work, we propose a bivariate Birnbaum-Saunders regression model through the use of bivariate Sinh-normal distribution. The proposed regression model has its marginal as the Birnbaum-Saunders regression model of Rieck and Nedelman (1991), which has been discussed extensively by various authors with natural applications in survival and reliability studies. This bivariate regression model can be used to analyze correlated log lifetimes of two units, in which the dependence structure between observations arises from the bivariate normal distribution.
   The main aim of this paper is to propose a bivariate Birnbaum-Saunders regression model and discuss some of its properties. Specifically, we have developed the moment estimation, the maximum likelihood estimation and the observed Fisher information matrix. Hypothesis testing is also performed by the use of the asymptotic normality of the maximum-likelihood estimators. Finally, the results of simulation studies as well as an application to a real data set are presented to illustrate the model and all the inferential methods developed here. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Birnbaum-Saunders distribution has received great attention in recent years, providing many useful techniques for analysis of positive response variables in several works. A regression model in a similar framework of a generalized linear models was proposed using a new parametrization of the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution. The purpose of this paper is to develop a Bayesian approach for this recent regression model. In addition, Bayesian influence diagnostic procedures will be discussed and compared with classical alternatives using Monte Carlo methods. Both approaches have similar results, but we propose a way to improve the Bayesian method.

AB In this paper, we show that the multiplicative bias correction (MBC) techniques can be applied for generalized Birnbaum-Saunders (GBS) kernel density estimators. First, some properties of the MBC-GBS kernel density estimators (bias, variance and mean integrated squared error) are shown. Second, the choice of bandwidth is investigated by adopting the popular cross-validation technique. Finally, the performances of the MBC estimators based on GBS kernels are illustrated by a simulation study, followed by a real application for nonnegative heavy tailed (HT) data. In general, in terms of integrated squared bias (ISB) and integrated squared error (ISE), the proposed estimators outperform the standard GBS kernel estimators.

AB This paper deals with the Bayesian inference for the parameters of the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution. We adopt the inverse-gamma priors for the shape and scale parameters because the continuous conjugate joint prior distribution does not exist and the reference prior (or independent Jeffreys' prior) results in an improper posterior distribution. We propose an efficient sampling algorithm via the generalized ratio-of-uniforms method to compute the Bayesian estimates and the credible intervals. One appealing advantage of the proposed procedure over other sampling techniques is that it efficiently generates independent samples from the required posterior distribution. Simulation studies are conducted to investigate the behavior of the proposed method, and two real-data applications are analyzed for illustrative purposes.

We consider gamma distribution, Weibull distribution and Birnbaum-Saunders distribution for designing the proposed plan. The optimal parameters are determined which will have minimum ASN. The efficiency of the proposed plan is also discussed over the traditional double sampling plan (DSP) and shown that the proposed plan performs better than the existing DSP. The extensive tables are provided for all the distributions and explained with the help of industrial data.

Maximum likelihood estimation of the model parameters of the new regression model is discussed for complete and censored samples. A modified deviance residual is proposed to assess departures from the log-odd Birnbaum-Saunders error assumption and to detect outlying observations. Real data sets are analyzed for illustrative purposes.

AB Birnbaum and Saunders (1969a) pioneered a lifetime model which is commonly used in reliability studies. Based on this distribution, a new model called the gamma Birnbaum-Saunders distribution is proposed for describing fatigue life data. Several properties of the new distribution including explicit expressions for the ordinary and incomplete moments, generating and quantile functions, mean deviations, density function of the order statistics, and their moments are derived. We discuss the method of maximum likelihood and a Bayesian approach to estimate the model parameters. The superiority of the new model is illustrated by means of three failure real data sets. We also propose a new extended regression model based on the logarithm of the new distribution. The last model can be very useful to the analysis of real data and provide more realistic fits than other special regression models.

AB Many engineering systems have multiple components with more than one degradation measure which is dependent on each other due to their complex failure mechanisms, which results in some insurmountable difficulties for reliability work in engineering. To overcome these difficulties, the system reliability prediction approaches based on performance degradation theory develop rapidly in recent years, and show their superiority over the traditional approaches in many applications. This paper proposes reliability models of systems with two dependent degrading components. It is assumed that the degradation paths of the components are governed by gamma processes. For a parallel system, its failure probability function can be approximated by the bivariate Birnbaum-Saunders distribution. According to the relationship of parallel and series systems, it is easy to find that the failure probability function of a series system can be expressed by the bivariate Birnbaum-Saunders distribution and its marginal distributions. The model in such a situation is very complicated and analytically intractable, and becomes cumbersome from a computational viewpoint. For this reason, the Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo method is developed for this problem that allows the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters to be determined in an efficient manner. After that, the confidence intervals of the failure probability of systems are given. For an illustration of the proposed model, a numerical example about railway track is presented.

Maximum likelihood estimates are obtained and Gibbs sampling procedure is used to get the Bayesian estimates for shape parameter of Birnbaum-Saunders distribution and parameters of power law-accelerated model. Asymptotic normality method and Markov Chain Monte Carlo method are employed to construct the corresponding confidence interval and highest posterior density interval at different confidence level, respectively.

AB With development of science and technology, many engineering systems take on high reliable characteristic and usually have complex structure and failure mechanisms, with their reliability being evaluated by multiple degradation measurements. In certain physical situations, the degradation of these performance characteristics would be always positive and strictly increasing. Therefore, the gamma process is usually considered as a degradation process due to its independent and non-negative increments properties. In this paper, we suppose that a system has multiple dependent performance characteristics and that their degradation can be modeled by gamma processes. For such a multivariate degradation involving three or more performance characteristics, we propose to use a multivariate Birnbaum-Saunders distribution and its marginal distributions to approximate the reliability function and give the corresponding lifetime distribution. And then, the inferential method for the model parameters is developed. Finally, for an illustration of the proposed model and method, a simulated example is discussed and some computational results are presented.

AB The Birnbaum-Saunders (BS) distribution is receiving considerable attention. We propose a methodology for inventory logistics that allows demand data with zeros to be modeled by means of a new discrete-continuous mixture distribution, which is constructed by using a probability mass at zero and a continuous component related to the BS distribution. We obtain some properties of the new mixture distribution and conduct a simulation study to evaluate the performance of the estimators of its parameters. The methodology for stochastic inventory models considers also financial indicators. We illustrate the proposed methodology with two real-world demand data sets. It shows its potential, highlighting the convenience of using it by improving the contribution margins of a Chilean food industry. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The number of failures is to be monitored by designing two pairs of upper and lower control limits. The necessary measurements are derived to assess the average run length (ARL). The various tables for ARLs are presented when the scale parameter and/or the shape parameter are shifted. The efficiency of the proposed control chart is compared with an existing chart. The proposed chart is shown to be more efficient than an existing control chart in terms of ARL. A real example is given for illustration purpose.

AB We studied sample-to-sample variability in the number of floating-gate errors induced by total-dose in NAND Flash memories at doses and in conditions where degradation of the peripheral circuitry is negligible. Experimental data are fitted with statistical methods, using several probability distribution functions commonly used in reliability studies. The lognormal and Birnbaum-Saunders functions provide the best fit to our dataset. The accuracy of using a reduced number of samples for estimating the parameters of these two distributions is evaluated, showing that the lognormal is a more robust choice. Finally, a physical model for sample-to-sample variability of floating-gate errors is presented, which leads to a nonstandard probability distribution, amenable to neither the lognormal nor the Birnbaum-Saunders, but still involving a Gaussian function.

AB Assessing environmental risk is useful for preventing adverse effects on human health in highly polluted cities. We design a criterion for environmental monitoring based on an attribute control chart for the number of dangerous contaminant levels when the concentration to be monitored follows a Birnbaum-Saunders distribution. This distribution is being widely applied to environmental data. We provide a novel justification for its usage in environmental sciences. The control coefficient and the minimum inspection concentration for the designed criterion are determined to yield the specified in-control average run length, whereas the out-of-control case is obtained according to a shift in the target mean. A simulation study is conducted to evaluate the proposed criterion, which reports its performance to provide earlier alerts of out-of-control processes. An application with real-world environmental data is carried out to validate its coherence with what is reported by the health authority. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Diverse phenomena from the real-world can be modeled using random matrices, allowing matrix-variate distributions to be considered. The normal distribution is often employed in this modeling, but usually the mentioned random matrices do not follow such a distribution. An asymmetric non-normal model that is receiving considerable attention due to its good properties is the Birnbaum-Saunders (BS) distribution. We propose a statistical methodology based on matrix-variate BS distributions. This methodology is implemented in the statistical software R. A simulation study is conducted to evaluate its performance. Finally, an application with real-world matrix-variate data is carried out to illustrate its potentiality and suitability.

ID FAMILY
AB The use of Birnbaum-Saunders distribution can be a good alternative for analyzing the equipment lifetime data. In this work two different prior distributions are used in the estimation of the parameters of the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution under the Bayesian approach and the presence of censored data type I and II. Assuming a prior dependence between the parameters, an alternative prior distribution based on copula function approach is proposed. Thus, a study to check if the priors lead to the same posterior inference is of great practical interest. Two examples are presented to illustrate the proposed methodology and investigate the performance of the prior distributions. The Bayesian analysis is performed based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to generate the posterior distribution samples.

AB Neurons transmit information as action potentials or spikes. Due to the inherent randomness of the inter-spike intervals (ISIs), probabilistic models are often used for their description. Cumulative damage (CD) distributions are a family of probabilistic models that has been widely considered for describing time-related cumulative processes. This family allows us to consider certain deterministic principles for modeling ISIs from a probabilistic viewpoint and to link its parameters to values with biological interpretation. The CD family includes the Birnbaum-Saunders and inverse Gaussian distributions, which possess distinctive properties and theoretical arguments useful for ISI description. We expand the use of CD distributions to the modeling of neural spiking behavior, mainly by testing the suitability of the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution, which has not been studied in the setting of neural activity. We validate this expansion with original experimental and simulated electrophysiological data.

AB Latent trait models for responses and response times in tests are often pure statistical models without a close connection to features of the assumed response process. In the present paper, a new model is presented that is more closely related to assumptions about the response process. The model is based on two increasing stochastic processes. Each stochastic process represents the accumulation of knowledge with respect to one of two response options, the correct and incorrect response. Both accumulators compete and the accumulator that first exceeds a critical level determines the response. General assumptions about the accumulators result in a race between two response times that follow a bivariate Birnbaum Saunders distribution. The model can be calibrated with marginal maximum likelihood estimation. Feasibility of the estimation approach is demonstrated in a simulation study. Additionally, a test of model fit is proposed. Finally, the model will be used for the analysis of an empirical data set.

Treating the variable bandwidths , of adaptive BS-PE kernel as parameters, we then propose a conjugate prior and estimate the 's by using the popular quadratic and entropy loss functions. Explicit formulas are obtained for the posterior and Bayes estimators. Comparison simulations with global unbiased cross-validation bandwidth selection technique were conducted under four HT distributions. Finally, two applications based on HT real data are presented and analyzed.

AB The normal/independent family of distributions is an attractive class of symmetric heavy-tailed density functions. They have a nice hierarchical representation to make inferences easily. We propose the Sinh-normal/independent distribution which extends the Sinh-normal (SN) distribution [23]. We discuss some of its properties and propose the Sinh-normal/independent nonlinear regression model based on a similar setup of Lemonte and Cordeiro [18], who applied the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution. We develop an EM-algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation of the model parameters. In order to examine the robustness of this flexible class against outlying observations, we perform a simulation study and analyze a real data set to illustrate the usefulness of the new model.

AB In this manuscript, we will focus on the development of a lot acceptance sampling plan for a multi-stage process based on time-truncated tests when the lifetime of a product follows a Weibull distribution. We will consider a plan when a single item is installed on a single tester (ordinary sampling plan) and another plan when multiple number of items can be installed on a single tester (group sampling plan). We will determine the plan parameters of the proposed sampling plans using the nonlinear optimization solution so as to minimize the average sample number. The tables are presented and explained with the help of an industrial example.

AB Sinh-normal distribution is a symmetric distribution with three parameters. In this paper, we introduce bivariate sinh-normal distribution, which has seven parameters. Due to presence of seven parameters it is a very flexible distribution. Different properties of this new distribution has been established. The model can be obtained as a bivariate Gaussian copula also. Therefore, using the Gaussian copula property, several properties of this proposed distribution can be obtained.. Maximum likelihood estimators cannot be obtained in closed forms. We propose to use two step estimators based on Copula, which can be obtained in a more convebient manner. One data analysis has been performed to see how the proposed model can be used in practice. Finally, we consider a bivariate model which can be obtained by transforming the sinh-normal distribution and it is a generalization of the bivariate Birnbaum-Saunders distribution. Several properties of the bivariate Birnbaum-Saunders distribution can be obtained as special cases of the proposed generalized bivariate Birnbaum-Saunders distribution.

Design parameters are obtained to ensure that true median life is longer than a given specified life at certain level of consumer's risk and producer's risk. We also explore situations under which design parameters based on median lifetime can be used for other percentile points. Tables and specific examples are reported to explain the proposed plans. Finally a real data set is analyzed to implement the plans in practical situations and some suggestions are given.

AB We motivate this paper by showing through Monte Carlo simulation that ignoring the skewness of the response variable distribution in non-linear regression models may introduce biases on the parameter estimates and/or on the estimation of the associated variability measures. Then, we propose a semiparametric regression model suitable for data set analysis in which the distribution of the response is strictly positive and asymmetric. In this setup, both median and skewness of the response variable distribution are explicitly modeled, the median using a parametric non-linear function and the skewness using a semiparametric function. The proposed model allows for the description of the response using the log-symmetric distribution, which is a generalization of the log-normal distribution and is flexible enough to consider bimodal distributions in special cases as well as distributions having heavier or lighter tails than those of the log-normal one. An iterative estimation process as well as some diagnostic methods are derived. Two data sets previously analyzed under parametric models are reanalyzed using the proposed methodology.

AB Univariate Birnbaum-Saunders distribution has received a considerable amount of attention during the last few years. Recently, Kundu et al. (2010) introduced a bivariate Birnbaum-Saunders distribution. It is observed that the bivariate Birnbaum-Saunders distributions can be written as the weighted mixture of bivariate inverse Gaussian distribution and its reciprocals. In this paper further we introduce a mixture of two bivariate Birnbaum-Saunders distributions and discuss its different properties. The mixture model has eleven parameters, hence it is a very flexible model. The maximum likelihood estimators cannot be obtained in explicit forms. We propose to use the EM algorithm to compute the maximum likelihood estimators. It is observed that it saves computational time significantly. We performed some simulation experiments, and one data analysis has been performed to illustrate the EM algorithm. It is observed that the performance of the EM algorithm is quite satisfactory.

AB The univariate fatigue life distribution proposed by Birnbaum and Saunders [A new family of life distributions. J Appl Probab. 1969;6:319-327] has been used quite effectively to model times to failure for materials subject to fatigue and for modelling lifetime data and reliability problems. In this article, we introduce a Birnbaum-Saunders (BS) distribution in the multivariate setting. The new multivariate model arises in the context of conditionally specified distributions. The proposed multivariate model is an absolutely continuous distribution whose marginals are univariate BS distributions. General properties of the multivariate BS distribution are derived and the estimation of the unknown parameters by maximum likelihood is discussed. Further, the Fisher's information matrix is determined. Applications to real data of the proposed multivariate distribution are provided for illustrative purposes.

AB Choosing the suitable demand distribution during lead-time is an important issue in inventory models. Much research has explored the advantage of following a distributional assumption different from the normality. The Birnbaum-Saunders (BS) distribution is a probabilistic model that has its genesis in engineering but is also being widely applied to other fields including business, industry, and management. We conduct numeric experiments using the R statistical software to assess the adequacy of the BS distribution against the normal and gamma distributions in light of the traditional lot size-reorder point inventory model, known as (Q, r). The BS distribution is well-known to be robust to extreme values; indeed, results indicate that it is a more adequate assumption under higher values of the lead-time demand coefficient of variation, thus outperforming the gamma and the normal assumptions.

Regression analysis is widely used in this context when some covariates are involved in the life-test. In this article, we discuss the maximum likelihood estimation of the model parameters and associated inference. We discuss the likelihood-ratio tests for some hypotheses of interest as well as some interval estimation methods. A Monte Carlo simulation study is then carried out to examine the performance of the proposed estimators and the interval estimation methods. Finally, some numerical data analyses are done for illustrating all the inferential methods developed here.

AB In this article, we propose an extension of the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution to model the more realistic situations where the fatigue failure time of a material is due to the growth of multiple cracks. Properties of the proposed extended Birnbaum-Saunders (EBS) distribution are discussed; hazard function and the change point of the hazard function of this EBS distribution are derived. Maximum likelihood estimates of the unknown parameters as well as the hazard functions for two special cases of the new EBS distribution are also obtained. Finally, Monte Carlo simulations are carried out to assess the performance of the EBS distribution parameters.

DE Goodness-of-fit test; Lifetime data; Maximum likelihood; Transformation

AB We consider a linear regression model in which responses are in the form of log-duration while the corresponding error is modeled by means of a nonstandard distribution. This lifetime model is estimated by maximum likelihood and the estimates are used as basis for omnibus goodness-of-fit tests for the error distribution. In particular, we suggest a specific transformation such that when it is applied to the residuals, the corresponding test of fit becomes nonparametric, in the sense that the null distribution of the test statistic is the same regardless of the specific distribution being tested or of the values of the parameters involved in the regression model (such as regression parameters or other parameters figuring in the error distribution). The proposed procedure is applied to regressions involving the Birnbaum-Saunders, the extended Weibull, and the generalized Weibull distributions.

AB The bivariate Sinh-Elliptical (BSE) distribution is a generalization of the well-known Rieck's (1989) Sinh-Normal distribution that is quite useful in Birnbaum-Saunders (BS) regression model. The main aim of this paper is to define the BSE distribution and discuss some of its properties, such as marginal and conditional distributions and moments. In addition, the asymptotic properties of method of moments estimators are studied, extending some existing theoretical results in the literature. These results are obtained by using some known properties of the bivariate elliptical distribution. This development can be viewed as a follow-up to the recent work on bivariate Birnbaum-Saunders distribution by Kundu et al. (2010) towards some applications in the regression setup. The measurement error models are also introduced as part of the application of the results developed here. Finally, numerical examples using both simulated and real data are analyzed, illustrating the usefulness of the proposed methodology. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this article, we give a new family of univariate distributions generated by the Logistic random variable. A special case of this family is the Logistic-Uniform distribution. We show that the Logistic-Uniform distribution provides great flexibility in modeling for symmetric, negatively and positively skewed, bathtub-shaped, "J"-shaped, and reverse "J"-shaped distributions. We discuss simulation issues, estimation by the methods of moments, maximum likelihood, and the new method of minimum spacing distance estimator. We also derive Shannon entropy and asymptotic distribution of the extreme order statistics of this distribution. The new distribution can be used effectively in the analysis of survival data since the hazard function of the distribution can be "J," bathtub, and concave-convex shaped. The usefulness of the new distribution is illustrated through two real datasets by showing that it is more flexible in analyzing the data than the Beta Generalized-Exponential, Beta-Exponential, Beta-Normal, Beta-Laplace, Beta Generalized half-Normal, beta-Birnbaum-Saunders, Gamma-Uniform, Beta Generalized Pareto, Beta Modified Weibull, Beta-Pareto, Generalized Modified Weibull, Beta-Weibull, and Modified-Weibull distributions.

AB A new distribution called the exponentiated generalized Birnbaum-Saunders distribution is proposed and studied. The new distribution is quite flexible to model survival data, reliability problems, fatigue life studies and hydrological data. It can have decreasing, increasing, upside-down bathtub, bathtub-shaped, increasing-decreasing-increasing and decreasing-increasing-decreasing hazard rate functions. We provide a comprehensive account of the mathematical properties of the new distribution and various structural quantities are derived. We discuss maximum likelihood estimation of the model parameters for uncensored and censored data. Two empirical applications of the new model to real data are presented for illustrative purposes.

AB In this paper, we propose a cure rate survival model by assuming that the number of competing causes of the event of interest follows the Poisson distribution and the time to event has the Birnbaum-Saunders (BS) distribution. We define the Poisson BS distribution and provide two useful representations for its density function which facilitate to obtain some mathematical properties. Two closed-form expressions for the moments of the new distribution are given. We estimate the parameters of the model with cure rate using maximum likelihood. For different parameter settings, sample sizes and censoring percentages, several simulations are performed. We derive the appropriate matrices for assessing local influence on the parameter estimates under different perturbation schemes and present some ways to perform a global influence study. We analyse a real data set from the medical area.

We provide some results on moments of a reparameterized version of the BS distribution and a generation method of random numbers from this distribution. In addition, we propose estimation and inference for the mentioned parameterization based on maximum likelihood, moment, modified moment and generalized moment methods. By means of a Monte Carlo simulation study, we evaluate the performance of the proposed estimators. We discuss applications of the reparameterized BS distribution from different scientific fields and analyze two real-world data sets to illustrate our results. The simulated and real data are analyzed by using the R software.

AB In this paper we propose an extension of the generalized half-normal distribution studied in Cooray and Ananda (Commun Stat 37:1323-1337, 2008). This new distribution is defined by considering the quotient of two random variables, the one in the numerator being a generalized half normal distribution and the one in the denominator being a power of the uniform distribution on , respectively. The resulting distribution has greater kurtosis than the generalized half normal distribution. The density function of this more general distribution is derived jointly with some of its properties and moments. We discuss stochastic representation, maximum likelihood and moments estimation. Applications to real data sets are reported revealing that the proposed distribution can fit real data better than the slashed half-normal, generalized half-normal and Birnbaum-Saunders distributions.

AB The Birnbaum-Saunders distribution is receiving considerable attention due to its good properties. One of its extensions is the class of scale-mixture Birnbaum-Saunders (SBS) distributions, which shares its good properties, but it also has further properties. The autoregressive conditional duration models are the primary family used for analyzing high-frequency financial data. We propose a methodology based on SBS autoregressive conditional duration models, which includes in-sample inference, goodness-of-fit and out-of-sample forecast techniques. We carry out a Monte Carlo study to evaluate its performance and assess its practical usefulness with real-world data of financial transactions from the New York stock exchange.

AB The Birnbaum-Saunders (BS) distribution is a positively skewed distribution, frequently used for analysing lifetime data. In this paper, we propose a simple method of estimation for the parameters of the two-parameter BS distribution by making use of some key properties of the distribution. Compared with the maximum likelihood estimators and the modified moment estimators, the proposed method has smaller bias, but having the same mean square errors as these two estimators. We also discuss some methods of construction of confidence intervals. The performance of the estimators is then assessed by means of Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, an example is used to illustrate the method of estimation developed here.

AB Process capability indices (PCIs) are tools widely used by the industries to determine the quality of their products and the performance of their manufacturing processes. Classic versions of these indices were constructed for processes whose quality characteristics have a normal distribution. In practice, many of these characteristics do not follow this distribution. In such a case, the classic PCIs must be modified to take into account the non-normality. Ignoring the effect of this non-normality can lead to misinterpretation of the process capability and ill-advised business decisions. An asymmetric non-normal model that is receiving considerable attention due to its good properties is the Birnbaum-Saunders (BS) distribution. We propose, develop, implement and apply a methodology based on PCIs for BS processes considering estimation, parametric inference, bootstrap and optimization tools. This methodology is implemented in the statistical software {\tt R}. A simulation study is conducted to evaluate its performance. Real-world case studies with applications for three data sets are carried out to illustrate its potentiality. One of these data sets was already published and is associated with the electronic industry, whereas the other two are unpublished and associated with the food industry.

ID LIFE DISTRIBUTIONS; FAMILY
AB Data on fatigue to exceed a critical value (or to grow to a critical level at which failure is likely to occur) is typically adjusted using the Birnbaum-Saunders (BS) distribution [see Birnbaum ZW, Saunders SC. A new family of life distributions. J Appl Probab. 1969a; 6: 319-327]. Although this type of distribution is asymmetric, in some cases the degree of skewness and/or kurtosis are outside the distributional range allowed by the BS distribution. Thus, a more adequate distribution model for better adjusting such unexpected deviations is called for. With this in mind, the main object of this paper is to propose an extension of the BS distribution based on the asymmetric alpha-power family of distributions [see PewseyA, G mez HW, Bolfarine H. Likelihood-based inference for power distributions. Test. 2012; 21(4): 775-789]. This extension is called the exponentiated BS distribution. We expect that by replacing the normal distribution by such more general family, a more flexible BS family is obtained. Asymmetry in the alpha-power family is controlled by a shape parameter, which also presents a similar performance in the extended BS family. The paper presents the density function for the extended BS and derives closed-form expressions for moments. Estimation is dealt with by using maximum likelihood estimators. Large sample inference can be conducted by using the Fisher information matrix derived in the paper. Estimation performance is studied by using a small scale simulation study. Results of a real application illustrates the good performance of the proposed approach.

AB The aim of this paper is to propose an approach to constructing lower confidence limits for a reliability function and investigate the effect of a sampling scheme on the performance of the proposed approach. This is accomplished by using a data-completion algorithm and certain Monte Carlo methods. The data-completion algorithm fills in censored observations with pseudo-complete data while the Monte Carlo methods simulate observations for complicated pivotal quantities. The Birnbaum-Saunders distribution, the lognormal distribution and the Weibull distribution are employed for illustrative purpose. The results of three cases of data-analysis are presented to validate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed methods. The first case is illustrated through simulated data, and the last two cases are illustrated through two real-data sets. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Birnbaum and Saunders [11] introduced a positive continuous distribution commonly used in reliability studies. Based on this distribution, we propose and study the called Kummer beta Birnbaum-Saunders distribution for modeling fatigue life data. Various properties of the new distribution including explicit expressions for the moments, generating function, mean deviations, density function of the order statistics and their moments are derived. We investigate maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters. The superiority of the new distribution is illustrated by means of two failure real data sets.

AB We address the issue of performing testing inference in generalized linear models when the sample size is small. This class of models provides a straightforward way of modeling normal and non-normal data and has been widely used in several practical situations. The likelihood ratio, Wald and score statistics, and the recently proposed gradient statistic provide the basis for testing inference on the parameters in these models. We focus on the small-sample case, where the reference chi-squared distribution gives a poor approximation to the true null distribution of these test statistics. We derive a general Bartlett-type correction factor in matrix notation for the gradient test which reduces the size distortion of the test, and numerically compare the proposed test with the usual likelihood ratio, Wald, score and gradient tests, and with the Bartlett-corrected likelihood ratio and score tests, and bootstrap-corrected tests. Our simulation results suggest that the corrected test we propose can be an interesting alternative to the other tests since it leads to very accurate inference even for very small samples. We also present an empirical application for illustrative purposes(1) (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In industrial statistics, there is great interest in predicting with precision lifetimes of specimens that operate under stress. For example, a bad estimation of the lower percentiles of a life distribution can produce significant monetary losses to organizations due to an excessive amount of warranty claims. The Birnbaum-Saunders distribution is useful for modeling lifetime data. This is because such a distribution allows us to relate the total time until the failure occurs to some type of cumulative damage produced by stress. In this paper, we propose a methodology for detecting influence of atypical data in accelerated life models on the basis of the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution. The methodology developed in this study should be considered in the design of structures and in the prediction of warranty claims. We conclude this work with an application of the proposed methodology on the basis of real fatigue life data, which illustrates its importance in a warranty claim problem.

AB We propose here a robust extension of the bivariate Birnbaum-Saunders (BS) distribution derived recently by Kundu et al. (2010). This extension is based on scale mixtures of normal (SMN) distributions that are used for modeling symmetric data. This type of bivariate Birnbaum-Saunders distribution based on SMN models is an absolutely continuous distribution whose marginals are of univariate Birnbaum-Saunders type. We then develop the EM-algorithm for the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation of the model parameters, and illustrate the obtained results with a real data and display the robustness feature of the estimation procedure developed here.

AB The Birnbaum-Saunders (BS) distribution is a positively skewed distribution and is a common model for analysing lifetime data. In this paper, we discuss the existence and uniqueness of the maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) of the parameters of BS distribution based on Type-I, Type-II and hybrid censored samples. The line of proof is based on the monotonicity property of the likelihood function. We then describe the numerical iterative procedure for determining the MLEs of the parameters, and point out briefly some recently developed simple methods of estimation in the case of Type-II censoring. Some graphical illustrations of the approach are given for three real data from the reliability literature. Finally, for illustrative purpose, we also present an example in which the MLEs do not exist.

ID LIFE DISTRIBUTIONS; FATIGUE; PARAMETERS; FAMILY; MODELS
AB Birnbaum-Saunders (BS) distribution is widely used in reliability applications to model failure times. For several samples from possible different BS distributions, to prevent wrong conclusions in any further analysis, it is of importance to accompany a formal comparison for characteristic quantities of the distributions, including mean, quantile and reliability function difference. To this end, two test statistics, which are respectively based on the exact generalized p-value approach and the Delta method, are proposed and their behaviours are investigated. Simulation studies are carried out to examine the size and power performance of the newly proposed statistics. An interesting phenomenon is that in the finite sample simulations we conduct, the Delta method-based test almost uniformly outperforms the generalized p-value-based test although its sampling null distribution is simulated by Monte Carlo method. This might suggest that the sampling null distribution of the Delta method-based test statisticwould have a fast convergence to its limit. The tests are also applied to analyse a real example on the fatigue life of 6061-T6 aluminium coupons for illustration.

The new class of distributions has as a particular case the two-parameter BS distribution. The hazard rate function of the proposed class can be increasing and upside-down bathtub shaped. We provide important mathematical properties such as moments, order statistics, estimation of the parameters and inference for large sample. Three special cases of the new class are investigated with some details. We illustrate the usefulness of the new distributions by means of two applications to real data sets.

The function was fitted to data from the inventory of permanent plots, measured at six ages. The adhesion function of the data was confirmed by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The diameter distribution models proposed showed acceptable values of correlation coefficient. The graphic analysis of residues showed no bias for function of two parameters and gamma = dapmin. The function with two parameters and gamma = dapmin can be used to describe the diameter distribution of eucalypt plantations.

AB A risk measure is a mapping from the random variables representing the risks to a number. It is estimated using historical data and utilized in making decisions such as allocating capital to each business line or deposit insurance pricing. Once a risk measure is obtained, an efficient monitoring system is required to quickly detect any drifts in the risk measure. This paper investigates the problem of detecting a shift in value at risk as the most widely used risk measure in insurance companies. The probabilistic C control chart and the parametric bootstrap method are employed to establish a risk monitoring scheme in insurance companies. Since the number of claims in a period is a random variable, the proposed method is a variable sample size scheme. Monte Carlo simulations for Weibull, Burr XII, Birnbaum-Saunders and Pareto distributions are carried out to investigate the behavior and performance of the proposed scheme. In addition, a real example from an insurance company is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The two-parameter Birnbaum-Saunders distribution is widely applicable to model failure times of fatiguing materials. Its maximum-likelihood estimators (MLEs) are very sensitive to outliers and also have no closed-form expressions. This motivates us to develop some alternative estimators. In this paper, we develop two robust estimators, which are also explicit functions of sample observations and are thus easy to compute. We derive their breakdown points and carry out extensive Monte Carlo simulation experiments to compare the performance of all the estimators under consideration. It has been observed from the simulation results that the proposed estimators outperform in a manner that is approximately comparable with the MLEs, whereas they are far superior in the presence of data contamination that often occurs in practical situations. A simple bias-reduction technique is presented to reduce the bias of the recommended estimators. Finally, the practical application of the developed procedures is illustrated with a real-data example.

AB In this paper, we introduce a new nonparametric kernel method for estimating asymmetric densities based on generalized skew-Birnbaum-Saunders distributions. Kernels based on these distributions have the advantage of providing flexibility in the asymmetry and kurtosis levels. In addition, the generalized skew-Birnbaum-Saunders kernel density estimators are boundary bias free and achieve the optimal rate of convergence for the mean integrated squared error of the nonnegative asymmetric kernel estimators. We carry out a data analysis consisting of two parts. First, we conduct a Monte Carlo simulation study for evaluating the performance of the proposed method. Second, we use this method for estimating the density of three real air pollutant concentration data sets. These numerical results favor the proposed nonparametric estimators.

AB A new class of extended Birnbaum-Saunders regression models is introduced. It can be applied to censored data and be used more effectively in survival analysis and fatigue life studies. Maximum likelihood estimation of the model parameters with censored data as well as influence diagnostics for the new regression model are investigated. The normal curvatures for studying local influence are derived under various perturbation schemes and a martingale-type residual is considered to assess departures from the extended Birnbaum-Saunders error assumption as well as to detect outlying observations. Further, a test of homogeneity of the shape parameters of the new regression model is proposed. Two real data sets are analyzed for illustrative purposes. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The present article proposes the skip lot sampling plan of type SkSP-2 using a group acceptance sampling plan for a time-truncated experiment as the reference plan, called SkGSP-2, when the lifetime of a product follows either the Weibull distribution or the generalized exponential distribution. The percentile life is used as the product quality in the proposed plan because assuring the percentile life is more practical than assuring the mean lifetime. The plan parameters such as the number of groups and the acceptance number are determined such that the specified values of producer's risk and consumer's risk are satisfied simultaneously. Extensive tables are provided for the selection of plan parameters according to various values of experiment time, percentiles ratios, and group size. Real-life examples are also given to illustrate the operation of the proposed plan.

AB The kernel method is a nonparametric procedure used to estimate densities with support in R. When nonnegative data are modeled, the classical kernel density estimator presents a bias problem in the neighborhood of zero. Several methods have been developed to reduce this bias, which include the boundary kernel, data transformation and reflection methods. An alternative proposal is to use kernel estimators based on distributions with nonnegative support, as is the case of the Birnbaum-Saunders (BS), gamma, inverse Gaussian and log-normal models. Generalized BS (GBS) distributions have received considerable attention, due to their properties and their flexibility in modeling different types of data. In this paper, we propose, characterize and implement the kernel method based on GBS distributions to estimate densities with nonnegative support. In addition, we provide a simple method to choose the corresponding bandwidth. In order to evaluate the performance of these new estimators, we conduct a Monte Carlo simulation study. The obtained results are illustrated by analyzing financial real data. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this paper is twofold. First we discuss the maximum likelihood estimators of the unknown parameters of a two-parameter Birnbaum-Saunders distribution when the data are progressively Type-II censored. The maximum likelihood estimators are obtained using the EM algorithm by exploiting the property that the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution can be expressed as an equal mixture of an inverse Gaussian distribution and its reciprocal. From the proposed EM algorithm, the observed information matrix can be obtained quite easily, which can be used to construct the asymptotic confidence intervals. We perform the analysis of two real and one simulated data sets for illustrative purposes, and the performances are quite satisfactory. We further propose the use of different criteria to compare two different sampling schemes, and then find the optimal sampling scheme for a given criterion. It is observed that finding the optimal censoring scheme is a discrete optimization problem, and it is quite a computer intensive process. We examine one sub-optimal censoring scheme by restricting the choice of censoring schemes to one-step censoring schemes as suggested by Balakrishnan (2007), which can be obtained quite easily. We compare the performances of the sub-optimal censoring schemes with the optimal ones, and observe that the loss of information is quite insignificant. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Metallized film capacitors possess characteristics of self-healing, high reliability, and long lifetime. Lifetime and reliability of capacitors are the key factors that ensure the stability of the electromagnetic launch system. In the capacitor lifetime test, it is a time-consuming work to get enough capacitance loss (CL) data to characterize the performance of the capacitor. Thus, it is necessary to analyze experimental data by effective lifetime prediction model (LPM). This paper first introduces the characteristics of CL in lifetime test. Then, it introduces traditional LPMs such as least square method (LSM) and Weibull distribution model (WDM). LSM is only appropriate when CL is uniform and steady, and it cannot analyze the lifetime reliability. WDM works best when large quantities of lifetime experiment data are acquired. In this paper, some new LPMs such as Birnbaum-Saunders distribution model and Poisson distribution model are introduced. New LPMs fully use CL in each shot, and it could faithfully reflect the work conditions of the capacitor. The analysis methods and steps of each model are put forward. In order to fully introduce these models, lifetime calculations are carried out based on the aforementioned LPMs.

AB Birnbaum and Saunders introduced in 1969 a two-parameter lifetime distribution which has been used quite successfully to model a wide variety of univariate positively skewed data. Diaz-Garcia and Leiva-Sanchez [8] proposed a generalized Birnbaum-Saunders distribution by using an elliptically symmetric distribution in place of the normal distribution. Recently, Kundu et al. [13] introduced a bivariate Birnbaum-Saunders distribution, based on a transformation of a bivariate normal distribution, and discussed its properties and associated inferential issues. In this paper, we construct a generalized multivariate Birnbaum-Saunders distribution, by using the multivariate elliptically symmetric distribution as a base kernel for the transformation instead of the multivariate normal distribution. Different properties of this distribution are obtained in the general case. Special emphasis is placed on statistical inference for two particular cases: (i) multivariate normal kernel and (ii) multivariate-t kernels. We use the maximized log-likelihood values for selecting the best kernel function. Finally, a data analysis is presented for illustrative purposes. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Inc.

We propose a new version of this distribution assuming that the number of terms of such a sum depends on a non-homogeneous Poisson process. The classical Birnbaum Saunders distribution is obtained when a homogeneous Poisson process is considered. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we propose a multivariate log-linear Birnbaum-Saunders regression model. We discuss maximum-likelihood estimation of the model parameters and provide closed-form expressions for the score function and for Fisher's information matrix. Hypothesis testing is performed using approximations obtained from the asymptotic normality of the maximum-likelihood estimator. Some influence methods, such as the local influence and generalized leverage are discussed and the normal curvatures for studying local influence are derived under some perturbation schemes. Further, a test for the homogeneity of the shape parameter of the multivariate regression model is investigated. A real data set is presented for illustrative purposes.

AB The Birnbaum-Saunders distribution is useful for modeling reliability data. In this paper we obtain adjusted profile maximum likelihood estimators for the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution shape parameter under type II data censoring. We consider the adjustments to the profile likelihood function proposed by Barndorff-Nielsen (1983), Cox and Reid (1987), Fraser and Reid (1995), Fraser et al. (1999) and Severini (1998, 1999). We obtain modified profile likelihood ratio tests and also consider bootstrap-based inference. Interval estimation is addressed as well. Several bootstrap confidence intervals are considered. Monte Carlo simulation results on point estimation, interval estimation and hypothesis testing inference are reported. Finally, we present two applications that use real (not simulated) data.

AB Mortality processes and the distribution of the diameter at breast height (DBH) of trees are two important problems in forestry. Trees die due to several factors caused by stress according to a phenomenon similar to material fatigue. Specifically, the force (rate) of mortality of trees quickly increases at a first stage and then reaches a maximum. In that moment, this rate slowly decreases until stabilizing at a constant value in the long term establishing a second stage of such a rate. Birnbaum-Saunders (BS) distributions are models that have received considerable attention currently due to their interesting properties. BS models have their genesis from a problem of material fatigue and present a failure or hazard rate (equivalent to the force of mortality) that has the same behavior as that of the DBH of trees. Then, BS distributions have arguments that transform them into models that can be useful in forestry. In this paper, we present a methodology based on BS distributions associated with this forest thematic. To complete this study, we perform an application of five real DBH data sets (some of them unpublished) that provides statistical evidence in favor of the BS methodology in relation to the forestry standard methodology. This application provides valuable financial information that can be used for making decisions in forestry.

AB The hazard rate is a statistical indicator commonly used in lifetime analysis. The Birnbaum-Saunders (BS) model is a life distribution originated from a problem pertaining to material fatigue that has been applied to diverse fields. The BS model relates the total time until failure to some type of cumulative damage that is normally distributed. The generalized BS (GBS) distribution is a class of positively skewed models with lighter and heavier tails than the BS distribution. Particular cases of GBS distributions are the BS and BS-Student-t (BS-t) models. In this paper, we discuss shape and change point analyses for the hazard rate of the BS-t distribution. In addition, we evaluate the performance of the maximum likelihood and moment estimators of this change point using Monte Carlo methods. We also present an application with a real life data set useful for survival analysis, which shows the convenience of knowing such instant of change for establishing a reduction in the dose and, as a consequence, in the cost of the treatment.

AB The heavy-tailed survival regression models provide a useful extension of the normal regression models for data sets involving errors with longer-than-normal tails. This article develops influence diagnostics under case-deletion model (CDM) in survival regression models for which the errors follow the log-generalized Birnbaum-Saunders distribution based on the t model (LBST). The one-step approximations of the estimates in CDM are given and case-deletion measures are obtained. Meanwhile, we discuss a score test for the homogeneity of shape parameter in LBST regression models. One numerical example is given to illustrate our methodology and the properties of the score test statistic are investigated through Monte Carlo simulations under different censoring percentages.

AB The genesis of two-way links between the inverse Gaussian and Birnbaum-Saunders distributions is explored and extended. The most general results apply to pairs of distributions with a general 'S-symmetry' structure involving a self-inverse function closely related to a transformation function with certain properties. These general results arise by transformation from very simple properties of the familiar Azzalini-type skew-symmetric distributions. They specialise again to relationships between R-symmetric and log-symmetric distributions, between various models related to the inverse Gaussian and Birnbaum-Saunders distributions, relationships involving the sinh-arcsinh transformation, and others. Simple random variate generation is a practical consequence of these relationships. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Lio et al (2010a, b) introduced two single acceptance sampling plans (SASPs) for the percentiles of Birnbaum-Saunders and Burr type XII distribution with a truncated censoring scheme. They assured that the acceptance sampling plans for percentiles significantly improve the traditional ones for mean life. In this paper, a double-sampling procedure is developed for Burr type XII distribution percentiles to save sample resource with a truncated censoring scheme. Minimum sample sizes for implementing the proposed double-sampling method are determined under the satisfied levels of consumer's risk and producer's risk. Illustrative examples are used to demonstrate the applications of the proposed method. Compared with the SASP, the proposed double-sampling acceptance plan uses less sample resource in average for truncated life testing.

AB We present for the first time a justification on the basis of central limit theorems for the family of life distributions generated from scale-mixture of normals. This family was proposed by Balakrishnan et al. (2009) and can be used to accommodate unexpected observations for the usual Birnbaum-Saunders distribution generated from the normal one. The class of scale-mixture of normals includes normal, slash, Student-t, logistic, double-exponential, exponential power and many other distributions. We present a model for the crack extensions where the limiting distribution of total crack extensions is in the class of scale-mixture of normals. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Birnbaum-Saunders model is a life distribution originated from a problem of material fatigue that has been largely studied and applied in recent decades. A random variable following the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution can be stochastically represented by another random variable used as basis. Then, the Birnbaum-Saunders model can be generalized by switching the distribution of the basis variable using diverse arguments allowing to construct more general classes of models. Extreme value distributions are useful to determinate the probability of events that are larger or smaller than others previously observed. In this paper, we propose, characterize, implement and apply an extreme value version of the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution.

AB We consider hazard (mortality) rates in heterogeneous populations consisting of ordered (in the defined stochastic sense) subpopulations. This setting can be interpreted via the fixed frailty models with one or more frailty parameters. The shape of the hazard rate is of main interest in this paper. Specifically, the deceleration and leveling off in the hazard rates (mortality plateaus) are discussed and some examples of lifetime distributions that can result in asymptotically flat hazard rates are considered. These examples are based on vitality models when an organism's initial vitality (resource) is 'consumed' in the course of life in accordance with a simple stochastic process (e.g., the Wiener process with drift or the gamma process).

Also, some diagnostic procedures are derived based on case-deletion and mean-shift outlier models such as one-step approximation, likelihood displacement, generalized Cook's distance, outlier tests and some measures for identifying influential observations on partial F-test. A test for homogeneity of shape parameter is also developed. Residuals and influence diagnostic tools are illustrated by means of an example that allows us to relate the response variable lifetime of a metal piece and the explanatory variable work per cycle. Three models were compared to fit the dataset, two of them with nonlinear systematic components. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The beta-Birnbaum-Saunders (Cordeiro and Lemonte, 2011) and Birnbaum-Saunders (Birnbaum and Saunders, 1969a) distributions have been used quite effectively to model failure times for materials subject to fatigue and lifetime data. We define the log-beta-Birnbaum-Saunders distribution by the logarithm of the beta-Birnbaum-Saunders distribution. Explicit expressions for its generating function and moments are derived. We propose a new log-beta-Birnbaum-Saunders regression model that can be applied to censored data and be used more effectively in survival analysis. We obtain the maximum likelihood estimates of the model parameters for censored data and investigate influence diagnostics. The new location-scale regression model is modified for the possibility that long-term survivors may be presented in the data. Its usefulness is illustrated by means of two real data sets.

AB In lifetime data analysis and particularly in engineering reliability contexts, the Birnbaum Saunders (BISA) density is often suggested as a suitable model; see Birnbaum and Saunders (1969), Mann et al. (1974), and Desmond (1985). A linear regression model, obtained from a logarithmic transformation of the response variable, is useful in studying the effect of covariates on the response variable; see Rieck and Nedelman (1991), Tsionas (2001) and Galea et al. (2004). In this paper, an extension of the log-linear regression model of Rieck and Nedelman (1991), which considers random effects, is introduced. From a Monte Carlo simulation study, the performance of various estimation and prediction methods are studied. The usefulness of the mixed log-linear model is stressed and compared to the pure fixed effects log-linear regression BISA model. The new model is used to analyze a real data set, for which a fixed effects model is inappropriate. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we establish a connection between the Hadamard product and the usual matrix multiplication. In addition, we study some new properties of the Hadamard product and explore the inverse problem associated with the established connection, which facilitates diverse applications. Furthermore, we propose a matrix-variate generalized Birnbaum-Saunders (GBS) distribution. Three representations of the matrix-variate GBS density are provided, one of them by using the mentioned connection. The main motivation of this article is based on the fact that the representation of the matrix-variate GBS density based on element-by-element specification does not allow matrix transformations. Consequently, some statistical procedures based on this representation, such as multivariate data analysis and statistical shape theory, cannot be performed. For this reason, the primary goal of this work is to obtain a matrix representation of the matrix-variate GBS density that is useful for some statistical applications. When the GBS density is expressed by means of a matrix representation based on the Hadamard product, such a density is defined in terms of the original matrices, as is common for many matrix-variate distributions, allowing matrix transformations to be handled in a natural way and then suitable statistical procedures to be developed.

AB This paper introduces a skewed log-Birnbaum-Saunders regression model based on the skewed sinh-normal distribution proposed by Leiva et al. [A skewed sinh-normal distribution and its properties and application to air pollution, Comm. Statist. Theory Methods 39 (2010), pp. 426-443]. Some influence methods, such as the local influence and generalized leverage, are presented. Additionally, we derived the normal curvatures of local influence under some perturbation schemes. An empirical application to a real data set is presented in order to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed model.

AB This study provides a model to estimate the parameters of the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution under an accelerated degradation test; this test evaluates the lifetime of a durable product. The difference between the proposed model and the existing models is that the proposed model considers the influence of the product materials and the random environmental effects, which would be viewed as a Wiener process addressed by the stochastic differential equation. The proposed model and the method of estimating parameters are illustrated using an ADT case, and the model performance is compared to that of Owen and Padgett (1999).

AB Lemonte and Cordeiro [Birnbaum-Saunders nonlinear regression models, Comput. Stat. Data Anal. 53 (2009), pp. 4441-4452] introduced a class of Birnbaum-Saunders (BS) nonlinear regression models potentially useful in lifetime data analysis. We give a general matrix Bartlett correction formula to improve the likelihood ratio (LR) tests in these models. The formula is simple enough to be used analytically to obtain several closed-form expressions in special cases. Our results generalize those in Lemonte et al. [Improved likelihood inference in Birnbaum-Saunders regressions, Comput. Stat. DataAnal. 54 (2010), pp. 1307-1316], which hold only for the BS linear regression models. We consider Monte Carlo simulations to show that the corrected tests work better than the usual LR tests.

AB The Birnbaum-Saunders (BS) model is a two-parameter, unimodal distribution with positive skewness and non-negative support. This model has attracted considerable attention in the statistical literature during the past decade. The interest for the BS model is due to its physical theoretical arguments, its attractive properties and its relationship with the normal model. However, no much attention has been payed in parameterizations of the BS distribution distinct to that proposed originally. In this paper, we study different parameterizations of the BS distribution. Specifically, we analyze the properties of these parameterizations, use the maximum likelihood method for estimating the corresponding parameters and carry out a simulation study for detecting their performance.

AB The stress concentration factor (SCF) is one of the most important parameters in the fatigue reliability analysis of steel offshore structures. This parameter exhibits considerable scatter which calls for greater emphasis in accurately computing the SCFs for predicting the fatigue life of these structures. As far as the authors are aware, no comprehensive research has been carried out on the probability distribution of SCFs in tubular joints, especially multi-planar ones, which cover the majority of practical applications. What has been used so far as the probability distribution of SCFs in the reliability analysis of offshore structures is mainly based on assumptions and limited observations, especially in terms of distribution parameters. In the present paper, results of performing FE analysis on 81 steel multi-planar tubular DKT-joints have been used to propose a probability distribution model for SCFs along the weld toe of the central brace under axial loads. Based on the multi-planar DKT-joint FE models which are verified against experimental results and the predictions of Lloyd's Register (LR) equations, a set of SCF sample databases was constructed. 15 different probability density functions (PDFs) were fitted to the relative frequency histograms of the SCF samples. The maximum likelihood method was used to determine the parameters of each distribution. Standard goodness-of-fit tests led to the conclusion that the Inverse Gaussian distribution is the best probability model for the peripheral distribution of SCFs along the weld toe and the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution is the best one for the maximum value of weld toe SCF.

AB The Birnbaum-Saunders distribution is a useful model for describing fatigue and reliability data. This model allows us to relate the total time until the failure to some type of cumulative damage. The majority of the models based on the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution have assumed fixed-effects, and a few have been investigated for correlated data. In this work, we introduce Birnbaum-Saunders mixed models for censored data. Specifically, we estimate their parameters by means of the Gauss-Hermite quadrature approximation, carry out a residual analysis for these models, and conduct an application using real censored reliability data. This application illustrates the utility of a Birnbaum-Saunders random intercept model.

AB We develop a Bayesian analysis for the class of Birnbaum-Saunders nonlinear regression models introduced by Lemonte and Cordeiro (Comput Stat Data Anal 53:4441-4452, 2009). This regression model, which is based on the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution (Birnbaum and Saunders in J Appl Probab 6:319-327, 1969a), has been used successfully to model fatigue failure times. We have considered a Bayesian analysis under a normal-gamma prior. Due to the complexity of the model, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are used to develop a Bayesian procedure for the considered model. We describe tools for model determination, which include the conditional predictive ordinate, the logarithm of the pseudo-marginal likelihood and the pseudo-Bayes factor. Additionally, case deletion influence diagnostics is developed for the joint posterior distribution based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Two empirical applications are considered in order to illustrate the developed procedures.

AB In this paper we introduce a new extension for the Birnbaum-Saunder distribution based on the family of the epsilon-skew-symmetric distributions studied in Arellano-Valle et al. (J Stat Plan Inference 128(2):427-443, 2005). The extension allows generating Birnbaun-Saunders type distributions able to deal with extreme or outlying observations (Dupuis and Mills, IEEE Trans Reliab 47:88-95, 1998). Basic properties such as moments and Fisher information matrix are also studied. Results of a real data application are reported illustrating good fitting properties of the proposed model.

AB Many highly reliable products usually have complex structure, with their reliability being evaluated by two or more performance characteristics. In certain physical situations, the degradation of these performance characteristics would be always positive and strictly increasing. In such a case, the gamma process is usually considered as a degradation process due to its independent and non-negative increments properties. In this paper, we suppose that a product has two dependent performance characteristics and that their degradation can be modeled by gamma processes. For such a bivariate degradation involving two performance characteristics, we propose to use a bivariate Birnbaum-Saunders distribution and its marginal distributions to approximate the reliability function. Inferential method for the corresponding model parameters is then developed. Finally, for an illustration of the proposed model and method, a numerical example about fatigue cracks is discussed and some computational results are presented. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In Bayesian analysis with objective priors, it should be justified that the posterior distribution is proper. In this paper, we show that the reference prior (or independent Jeffreys prior) of a two-parameter Birnbaum-Saunders distribution will result in an improper posterior distribution. However, the posterior distributions are proper based on the reference priors with partial information (RPPI). Based on censored samples, slice sampling is utilized to obtain the Bayesian estimators based on RPPI. Monte Carlo simulations are used to compare the efficiencies of different RPPIs, to assess the sensitivity of the choice of the priors, and to compare the Bayesian estimators with the maximum likelihood estimators, for various scales of sample size and degree of censoring. A real data set is analyzed for illustrative purpose. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The two-parameter Birnbaum-Saunders distribution has been used successfully to model fatigue failure times. Although censoring is typical in reliability and survival studies, little work has been published on the analysis of censored data for this distribution. In this paper, we address the issue of performing testing inference on the two parameters of the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution under type-II right censored samples. The likelihood ratio statistic and a recently proposed statistic, the gradient statistic, provide a convenient framework for statistical inference in such a case, since they do not require to obtain, estimate or invert an information matrix, which is an advantage in problems involving censored data. An extensive Monte Carlo simulation study is carried out in order to investigate and compare the finite sample performance of the likelihood ratio and the gradient tests. Our numerical results show evidence that the gradient test should be preferred. Further, we also consider the generalized Birnbaum-Saunders distribution under type-II right censored samples and present some Monte Carlo simulations for testing the parameters in this class of models using the likelihood ratio and gradient tests. Three empirical applications are presented. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

For all these models, we study their characteristics including the shape of their density and hazard rate functions. For the maximum likelihood estimation of the model parameters, we use the EM algorithm. For the purpose of illustration, we analyze two data sets related to enzyme and depressive condition problems. In the case of the enzyme data, it is shown that Model 1 provides the best fit, while for the depressive condition data, it is shown all three models fit well with Model 3 providing the best fit.

AB The Birnbaum-Saunders (BS) model is a life distribution with interesting properties and applications in several fields. This has transformed the BS model in an important research focus in recent decades. However, the sum of BS (BSsum) independent random variables does not follow a BS distribution. By means of the BSsum distribution, we can monitor the lifetime of products subject to failures using a quality control chart. Classic procedures for control charts assume normality in the distribution of the data. Nevertheless, one of the main characteristics of the lifetimes is that them generally follow asymmetric distributions. Therefore, if we want to monitor these lifetimes, we must consider control charts for asymmetric distributions, such as it is the case of the BS distribution. The monitoring of the lifetimes is carried out generally by the accumulated lifetime or the lifetime average until than a number of failures occurs. Thus, by using the BSsum distribution, we develop, implement and apply a new methodology for control charts based on the BS distribution.

AB The Birnbaum-Saunders distribution has recently received considerable attention in the statistical literature, including some applications in the environmental sciences. Several authors have generalized this distribution, but these generalizations are still inadequate for predicting extreme percentiles. In this paper, we consider a variation of the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution, which enables the prediction of extreme percentiles as well as the implementation of the EM algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation of the distribution parameters. This implementation has some advantages over the direct maximization of the likelihood function. Finally, we present results of a simulation study along with an application to a real environmental data set. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The one-step approximations of the estimates in CDM are given and case-deletion measures are obtained. Meanwhile, it is shown that CDM is equivalent to mean shift outlier model (MSOM) in LBS regression models and an outlier test is presented based on MSOM. Furthermore, we discuss a score test for homogeneity of shape parameter in LBS regression models. Two numerical examples are given to illustrate our methodology and the properties of score test statistic are investigated through Monte Carlo simulations under different censoring percentages.

AB The Birnbaum-Saunders distribution has been used quite effectively to model times to failure for materials subject to fatigue and for modeling lifetime data. In this paper we obtain asymptotic expansions, up to order n(-1/2) and under a sequence of Pitman alternatives, for the non-null distribution functions of the likelihood ratio, Wald, score and gradient test statistics in the Birnbaum-Saunders regression model. The asymptotic distributions of all four statistics are obtained for testing a subset of regression parameters and for testing the shape parameter. Monte Carlo simulation is presented in order to compare the finite-sample performance of these tests. We also present two empirical applications. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Birnbaum-Saunders regression model is becoming increasingly popular in lifetime analyses and reliability studies. In this model, the signed likelihood ratio statistic provides the basis for testing inference and construction of confidence limits for a single parameter of interest. We focus on the small sample case, where the standard normal distribution gives a poor approximation to the true distribution of the statistic. We derive three adjusted signed likelihood ratio statistics that lead to very accurate inference even for very small samples. Two empirical applications are presented. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this paper, we propose a method to assess influence in skew-Birnbaum-Saunders regression models, which are an extension based on the skew-normal distribution of the usual Birnbaum-Saunders (BS) regression model. An interesting characteristic that the new regression model has is the capacity of predicting extreme percentiles, which is not possible with the BS model. In addition, since the observed likelihood function associated with the new regression model is more complex than that from the usual model, we facilitate the parameter estimation using a type-EM algorithm. Moreover, we employ influence diagnostic tools that considers this algorithm. Finally, a numerical illustration includes a brief simulation study and an analysis of real data in order to show the proposed methodology.

Our results generalize those in Galea et al. [8] which are confined to Birnbaum-Saunders linear regression models. Some influence methods, such as the local influence, total local influence of an individual and generalized leverage are discussed. Additionally, the normal curvatures for studying local influence are derived under some perturbation schemes. We also give an application to a real fatigue data set.

AB Jorgensen et al. [14] introduced a three-parameter generalized inverse Gaussian distribution, which is a mixture of the inverse Gaussian distribution and length biased inverse Gaussian distribution. Also Birnbaum-Saunders distribution is a special case for p = 1/2, where p is the mixing parameter. It is observed that the estimators of the unknown parameters can be obtained by solving a three-dimensional optimization process, which may not be a trivial issue. Most of the iterative algorithms are quite sensitive to the initial guesses. In this paper, we propose to use the EM algorithm to estimate the unknown parameters for complete and censored samples. In the proposed EM algorithm, at the M-step the optimization problem can be solved analytically, and the observed Fisher information matrix can be obtained. These can be used to construct asymptotic confidence intervals of the unknown parameters. Some simulation experiments are conducted to examine the performance of the proposed EM algorithm, and it is observed that the performances are quite satisfactory. The methodology proposed here is illustrated by three data sets.

We derive a simple matrix formula for second-order covariances of maximum-likelihood estimators in this class of models. The formula is quite suitable for computer implementation, since it involves only simple operations on matrices and vectors. Some simulation results show that the second-order covariances can be quite pronounced in small to moderate sample sizes. We also present empirical applications.

Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are used to develop a Bayesian procedure for the considered model. In order to attenuate the influence of the outlying observations on the parameter estimates, we present in this paper Birnbaum-Saunders models in which a Student-t distribution is assumed to explain the cumulative damage. Also, some discussions on the model selection to compare the fitted models are given and case deletion influence diagnostics are developed for the joint posterior distribution based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence. The developed procedures are illustrated with a real data set. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Probability distributions of bed load transport rates: A new derivation

SO WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH

ID BEDLOAD-TRANSPORT; GRAVEL-BED; SEDIMENT TRANSPORT; TEMPORAL VARIATIONS;
   MOTION; RIVERS; FLUCTUATIONS; VARIABILITY; PITZBACH; STORAGE
AB It has been known for a long time that sediment transport rates can vary strongly even if the ambient hydraulic conditions remain steady. In this article, a new approach is described to derive probability distributions of bed load transport rates, starting from the waiting time between the arrivals of individual sediment particles. The formalism should be valid when transport is not dominated by bed form motion. Without any assumptions about the distribution of interarrival times, the approach yields the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution, a two-parameter distribution previously used in lifetime modeling. Observed dependence of mean transport rates on the sampling time and multiscaling are predicted by the distribution. Assuming exponentially and Poisson-distributed interarrival times, the same approach yields the Poisson and the gamma distributions. Using a high-resolution bed load transport data set from the Pitzbach, Austria, the distribution functions are tested on field data. The gamma distribution best describes the data, with maximum deviations of similar to 5%. However, the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution may be more useful in certain applications, as it is a general approximation in the proposed formalism and no debated assumptions are necessary for its derivation.

AB In this paper, we introduce a new class of mixture models based on the inverse Gaussian distribution; which is highly flexible and contains several well-known probability models. The new class of models is generated from symmetric distributions around zero by using the connection between the inverse Gaussian and standard normal distributions. We illustrate the obtained results by means of two real data sets through likelihood, goodness-of-fit and diagnostic methods. This illustration indicates the adequacy of the new model.

AB In this article, we introduce, characterize and apply an extended version of the Birnbaum-Saunders model based on the Mudolkar-Hutson skew distribution. This model is appropriated for describing phenomena involving accumulation of some type, as is the case of environmental contamination. Specifically, we find the density, distribution function, and moments of the new model. In addition, we derive several properties and transformations related to this distribution. Furthermore, we propose an estimation method for the parameters of the model. Moreover, we conduct a study of its hazard rate focuses in environmental analysis. A computational implementation in R language of the obtained results is discussed. Finally, we present two examples with real data from environmental quality in Chile that illustrate the proposed methodology.

AB In this paper we introduce the Birnbaum-Saunders autoregressive conditional duration (BS-ACD) model as an alternative to the existing ACD models which allow a unimodal hazard function. The BS-ACD model is the first ACD model to integrate the concept of conditional quantile estimation into an ACD model by specifying the time-varying model dynamics in terms of the conditional median duration, instead of the conditional mean duration. In the first half of this paper we illustrate how the BS-ACD model relates to the traditional ACD model, and in the second half we discuss the assessment of goodness-of-fit for ACD models in general. In order to facilitate both of these points, we explicitly illustrate the similarities and differences between the BS-ACD model and the Generalized Gamma ACD (GG-ACD) model by comparing and contrasting their formulation, estimation, and results from fitting both models to samples for six NYSE securities.

ID INFLUENCE DIAGNOSTICS; FAMILY; MODELS
AB The Birnbaum-Saunders regression model is commonly used in reliability studies. We address the issue of performing inference in this class of models when the number of observations is small. Our simulation results suggest that the likelihood ratio test tends to be liberal when the sample size is small. We obtain a correction factor which reduces the size distortion of the test. Also, we consider a parametric bootstrap scheme to obtain improved critical values and improved p-values for the likelihood ratio test. The numerical results show that the modified tests are more reliable in finite samples than the usual likelihood ratio test. We also present an empirical application. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB The family of distributions proposed by Birnbaum and Saunders (1969) can be used to model lifetime data and it is widely applicable to model failure times of fatiguing materials. We give a simple matrix formula of order n(-1/2), where n is the sample size, for the skewness of the distributions of the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters in Birnbaum-Saunders nonlinear regression models, recently introduced by Lemonte and Cordeiro (2009). The formula is quite suitable for computer implementation, since it involves only simple operations on matrices and vectors, in order to obtain closed-form skewness in a wide range of nonlinear regression models. Empirical and real applications are analyzed and discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Estimation for the Birnbaum-Saunders (BS) regression model has been discussed by various authors when data are either complete or subject to Type-I or random censoring. But, this problem has not been considered for the case of interval censoring. In this article, we discuss the estimation of a regression model with current status data when the failure times follow the BS distribution. We estimate the parameters by the method of maximum likelihood, and derive the asymptotic distribution of these estimators. The performance of these estimators is then assessed through Monte Carlo simulations for different sample sizes under two types of monitoring. Finally, an analysis of real data is used to illustrate the proposed method. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Goodness-of-fit tests are constructed for the two-parameter Bimbaum-Saunders distribution in the case where the parameters are unknown and are therefore estimated from the data. With each test the procedure starts by computing efficient estimators of the parameters. Then the data are transformed to normality and normality tests are applied on the transformed data, thereby avoiding reliance on parametric asymptotic critical values or the need for bootstrap computations. Two classes of tests are considered, the first class being the classical tests based on the empirical distribution function, while the other class utilizes the empirical characteristic function. All methods are extended to cover the case of generalized three-parameter Birnbaum-Saunders distributions. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In many Solvency and Basel loss data, there are thresholds or deductibles that affect the analysis capability. On the other hand, the Birnbaum-Saunders model has received great attention during the last two decades and it can be used as a loss distribution. In this paper, we propose a solution to the problem of deductibles using a truncated version of the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution. The probability density function, cumulative distribution function, and moments of this distribution are obtained. In addition, properties regularly used in insurance industry, such as multiplication by a constant (inflation effect) and reciprocal transformation, are discussed. Furthermore, a study of the behavior of the risk rate and of risk measures is carried out. Moreover, estimation aspects are also considered in this work. Finally, an application based on real loss data from a commercial bank is conducted.

In this article, acceptance sampling plans are developed for the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution percentiles when the life test is truncated at a pre-specified time. The minimum sample size necessary to ensure the specified life percentile is obtained under a given customer's risk. The operating characteristic values (and curves) of the sampling plans as well as the producer's risk are presented. The R package named spbsq is developed to implement the developed sampling plans.

AB Several models are proposed in the literature for modeling fatigue data resulting from materials subject to cyclic stress and strain. Accelerated Weibull and accelerated Birnbaum-Saunders distributions are most commonly used models. Whereas the accelerated Weibull model is easier compared to accelerated Birnbaum-Saunders, it fails to represent the situation equally well. The present article focuses on Bayes analysis of the two models and provides a comparison based on some important Bayesian tools. Model compatibility study using predictive simulation ideas is preceded by the said comparison. Throughout, the posterior simulations are carried out by Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure.

AB In this article, we introduce a skewed version of the sinh-normal distribution and discuss some of its properties. In addition, we characterize an extension of the Birnbaum-Saunders model associated with this distribution from a probabilistic viewpoint along with a lifetime analysis based on its hazard rate. Finally, one of the proposed models is applied to air pollution data in order to illustrate its usefulness.

AB In this paper we consider the Bayesian estimators for the unknown parameters of the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution under the reference prior. The Bayesian estimators cannot be obtained in closed forms. An approximate Bayesian approach is proposed using the idea of Lindley and Gibbs sampling procedure is also used to obtain the Bayesian estimators. These results are compared using Monte Carlo simulations with the maximum likelihood method and another approximate Bayesian approach Laplace's approximation. Two real data sets are analyzed for illustrative purposes. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Univariate Birnbaum-Saunders distribution has been used quite effectively to model positively skewed data, especially lifetime data and crack growth data. In this paper, we introduce bivariate Birnbaum-Saunders distribution which is all absolutely continuous distribution whose marginals are Univariate Birnbaum-Saunders distributions. Different properties of this bivariate Birnbaum-Saunders distribution are then discussed. This new family has five unknown parameters and it is shown that the maximum likelihood estimators can be obtained by solving two non-linear equations. We also propose simple modified moment estimators for the Unknown parameters which are explicit and call therefore be used effectively as all initial guess for the Computation Of the maximum likelihood estimators. We then present the asymptotic distributions of the maximum likelihood estimators and use them to construct confidence intervals for the parameters. We also discuss likelihood ratio tests for some hypotheses of interest. Monte Carlo simulations are then carried Out to examine the performance of the proposed estimators. Finally, a numerical data analysis is performed in order to illustrate all the methods of inference discussed here. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
