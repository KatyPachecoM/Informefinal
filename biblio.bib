	abstract = {Modern financial markets now record the precise time of each stock trade, along with price and volume, with the aim of analysing the structure of the times between trading events—leading to a big data problem. In this paper, we propose and compare two Birnbaum–Saunders autoregressive conditional duration models specified in terms of time-varying conditional median and mean durations. These models provide a novel alternative to the existing autoregressive conditional duration models due to their flexibility and ease of estimation. Diagnostic tools are developed to allow goodness-of-fit assessment and to detect departures from assumptions, including the presence of outliers and influential cases. These diagnostic tools are based on the parameter estimates using residual analysis and the Cook distance for global influence, and different perturbation schemes for local influence. A thorough Monte Carlo study is presented to evaluate the performance of the maximum likelihood estimators, and the forecasting ability of the models is assessed using the traditional and density forecast evaluation techniques. The Monte Carlo study suggests that the parameter estimators are asymptotically unbiased, consistent and normally distributed. Finally, a full analysis of a real-world financial transaction data set, from the German DAX in 2016, is presented to illustrate the proposed approach and to compare the fitting and forecasting performances with existing models in the literature. One case related to the duration time is identified as potentially influential, but its removal does not change resulting inferences demonstrating the robustness of the proposed approach. Fitting and forecasting performances favor the proposed models and, in particular, the median-based approach gives additional protection against outliers, as expected.},

	abstract = {In this paper we introduce the Birnbaum–Saunders autoregressive conditional duration (BS-ACD) model as an alternative to the existing ACD models which allow a unimodal hazard function. The BS-ACD model is the first ACD model to integrate the concept of conditional quantile estimation into an ACD model by specifying the time-varying model dynamics in terms of the conditional median duration, instead of the conditional mean duration. In the first half of this paper we illustrate how the BS-ACD model relates to the traditional ACD model, and in the second half we discuss the assessment of goodness-of-fit for ACD models in general. In order to facilitate both of these points, we explicitly illustrate the similarities and differences between the BS-ACD model and the Generalized Gamma ACD (GG-ACD) model by comparing and contrasting their formulation, estimation, and results from fitting both models to samples for six NYSE securities.},

	abstract = {Big Data concerns large-volume, complex, growing data sets with multiple, autonomous sources. With the fast development of networking, data storage, and the data collection capacity, Big Data is now rapidly expanding in all science and engineering domains, including physical, biological and biomedical sciences. This article presents a HACE theorem that characterizes the features of the Big Data revolution, and proposes a Big Data processing model, from the data mining perspective. This data-driven model involves demand-driven aggregation of information sources, mining and analysis, user interest modeling, and security and privacy considerations. We analyze the challenging issues in the data-driven model and also in the Big Data revolution.},
